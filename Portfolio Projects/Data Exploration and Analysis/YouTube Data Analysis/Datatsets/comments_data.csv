We hope that you are a free, broad-minded person free from prejudice whose goal is to find the truth. Before we continue, let us declare to you the purpose of this letter - that it is an introduction and invitation to the lifestyle known as Islam.\n\n\n\n\u200fSOME FACTS\n\n\n\n\u200fIslam has approximately 2 billion followers known as Muslims who follow the final revelation to mankind, known as the ""Qur\'an"", revealed to Prophet Muhammad about 1400 years ago. Contrary to the common misconception, only about 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the rest are Indians, Indonesians, Bosnians,Africans,Chinese,turkish and so on\n. \n\n\n\u200fWHAT IS ISLAM\n\n\n\n\u200fIslam, unlike most other religions, is not named after any man. Instead Islam means the submission of one\'s will to the only true god worthy of worship ""Allah"" and anyone who does so is termed a ""Muslim"". The word also implies ""peace"" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Islam is the religion that was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind like Jesus and Moses\n. \n\n\n\u200fTHE MESSAGE OF ISLAM\n\n\n\n\u200fThe most important message of Islam is the absolute Unity of God-that there is only One Supreme Being who has no partners and is not dependent on anyone or anything. He is the creator of everything and the whole universe is under His control. Since the total submission of one\'s will to Allah represents the essence of worship, Islam is the worship of Allah alone and the avoidance of worship directed to any person, place or thing other than Allah. In essence, Islam calls man away from the worship of creation and invites him to worship only its Creator. Allah is the only one deserving man\'s worship as it is only by His will that prayers are answered. Hence prayers to the non-living such as the sun, fire, and to humans whether they be Jesus, Moses or even Muhammad are rejected, as Allah informs us in the opening chapter of the Qur\'an, known as Soorah Al-Faatihah, verse 4: \n\n\u200f""You alone do we worship and from you alone do we seek help.""\n\n\u200fA Muslim believes that Allah and His creation are distinctly different \n\u200fentities. Neither is Allah His creation or a part of it, nor is His creation Him or a part of Him. Ultimately, it is the belief that the essence of Allah is everywhere in His creation or that His divine being is or was present in some aspects of His creation, which has provided justification for the worship of creation. Islam, hence, is a clear call to the worship of the Creator and the rejection of creation-worship in any form. \n\n\n\n\u200fTHE MIRACLE OF QUR\'AN\n\n\n\n\u200f""And if you are in doubt as to what We [Allah] have revealed…then produce a Soorah (chapter) like thereunto""(Soorah Baqarah 2:23)\n\u200fThis was the challenge put forth by Allah in the Qur\'an 1400 years ago. As of yet, none has or will ever come close to meeting this challenge. Hence, as a result, multitudes throughout the centuries have believed and continue to believe in the Qur\'an as a revelation beyond any human capacity. Modern scientists, for instance, have been amazed by the accuracy of scientific information presented in the Qur\'an. Here are just a few examples: \n\n\u200fIn his book of embryology-\'The Developing Human\' [W.B. Saunders Publishing, 1982], Dr. Keith Moore added a whole chapter to discuss the scientific accuracy of the Quranic discussion of this science. Another eminent scientist, Dr. Maurice Bucaille wrote in his book-\'The Bible, the Qur\'an and Science\': \n\n\u200f""I could not find a single error in the Qur\'an…if a man was the author of the Qur\'an how could he have written facts in the 7th century A.D. that today are shown to be in keeping with modern scientific knowledge""\n\u200fFacts about astronomy, the animal world and other natural phenomenon, that were alien to modern science not long ago, are scattered among the messages of Allah\'s Unity and His Attributes throughout the miracle that is known as al-Qur\'an\n. \n\n\n\u200fWHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER RELIGIONS\n\n\n\n\u200fThere are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the only true path to Allah. How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various religions, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept concerning Allah: they either claim that all human beings are gods or that specific individuals were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man\'s imagination. For example, Prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah while Jesus himself would deny this as Allah says in the Qur\'an: \n\n\u200f""And behold Allah will say: ""O Jesus the son of Mary Did you say to men, Worship me and my mother as gods besides Allah; He [Jesus] will say-""Glory to You I could never say what I had no right (to say\')"" (Soorah Al-Maa\'idah- 5:116)\n\n\u200fEven though false religions might teach some good things, they all, however, teach the greatest evil- the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation, which is the worship of Allah as explained in the following verses: \n\n\u200f""Verily Allah will not forgive the joining of partners with Him, but He may forgive (sins) less than that for whom so ever He wishes"" (Soorah An- Nisaa 4:48 and 116)\n\u200f""I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me"" (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)\n\n\n\n             Why do I have to be muslim ?\n\n\n\u200fSince the consequences of false religion are so grave, the true religion of Allah must be universally understandable and attainable, not confined to any people, place or time. Within the central principle of Islam and in its definition, lies the roots of lslam\'s universality. Whenever man comes to the realization that Allah is one and distinct from His creation, and submits himself to Allah, he becomes a Muslim and is eligible for paradise. This is the essence and the corner-stone of Islam: \n\u200f""Laa Elaaha lllallaah"" (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah) \n\n\u200fIts repetition and the sincere belief in it automatically brings one within the fold of Islam and guarantees one Paradise. Thus, the final prophet of Islam is reported to have said, ""Any one who says: there is no god but Allah and dies holding that (belief) will enter paradise.""

God alone justifies a repentant sinner when the sinner places their trust in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone. Do not let some church or false teacher lead you to Hell.\n\n“But as many as received him (Jesus Christ), to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” – John 1:12-13']"

I have yet to try raising the water PH value naturally but on the data I have gathered it will help a lot.', ""Hi Benn,\nI also had and still have problems with my hair. I have done a hair transplant. It is much better than before, but still far from the original state, when I had full dense hair. So I can really relate to all that you are going through.\nOne question: when you tell your story, including your ex girlfriend and other flashbacks, how do you implement that exactly? You don't ask your ex-girlfriend if you can re-enact your meeting and breakup for your video. Best regards, my friend."", ""My two pence... For someone who cares so much about his hair I'm surprised that you focus people's attention on your hair with a weird haircut. Every hair can be stylised, perhaps you need to see a physiognomist hairdresser. \nLiving in the most beautiful place in the world like Bali could be a mistake because it will become a boring place to you, where you'll find many things to criticise. It's all about balance in my opinion - you can never be disappointed with an average location when it comes to life and base yourself there. You can always go on holiday to beautiful places. If your mind is not in the right place, moving is not a solution because your problems will move with you. \nSometimes it's best to work on yourself rather than try and grow hair or want to move somewhere else hoping your life and mental health will get better. Moving or taking pills are short term solutions! Positive thinking is the way to go.  \nFinally, I went freelance a few years ago and loved the freedom. A year ago I had to move and so had to started the business all over again so I took a part time job where I could work when I wanted, perhaps one day a week, as a safety net. I ended up doing more shifts and less freelance. And bit by bit I became so happy and relieved doing more and more shifts and less and less freelance work. Freelance work is non stop. Every second of every day we think about our work. Now I stopped my freelance work, I earn less money but I'm comfortable in my life and much happier - less stress and more time for me and my partner. When I leave work I completely forget about it. My work has no real responsibility, it's simple and easy. And it finishes, unlike freelance work. \nYou are a very handsome man so I'm sure you will find someone, you are still young so no need to worry. Even if you meet someone at 35, you can easily spend 40 years with them which is more than enough! \nSocial media is not real - people say they love you and that you are amazing. But in real life nobody who doesn't know you will stop you in the street and randomly say you are amazing. Perhaps you need to experience a more real life for a while."", ""You have incredible talent! This is the second video I am watching from INDIA! \nI really do think that you should make a movie.

As someone who also flies fpv, although there are many compelling aspects of the dji fpv drone, there are some very obvious disadvantages, such as less performance (than something like a 6s 5” fpv quad), more prone to breaking due to weaker materials, plus repairs will be expensive because dji parts are always very expensive, and the radio has very small gimbals for an expensive fpv drone. You also said it takes months to learn how to build an fpv drone, which is untrue, it can be learnt much more quickly than that. You also did not mention that prebuilt fpv drones exist and offer good and cheap entry to the hobby. Also, a lot of the things you would consider disadvantages of building your own fpv drone I would consider a pro. Many of the extra things you have to do give an extra layer of user control, such as charging the lipos and setting everything up in betaflight.

Answering some basic questions -\n\n1. Practice flying fpv on computer for 50 hours and you are ready to fly like this. \n\nDo it 100 hours, you will do way better. \n\nIt’s like any other skill. Needs a lot of practice at home before you start flying in real!  \n\n2. If you want to fly with motion controller you can do it on first day. But I would suggest learn the technique first and then go for this one. It’s way easier to setup than custom made fpv and the overall experience is way better on avata then any other fpv.\n\nAlso I started my journey with custom made fpv but I lost the inspiration because it’s too bulky to carry, way more risky to loose. And I lost the inspiration to fly fpv. But now with avata it does every thing what I look for.\n\nIf you want to make a full time career as a fpv pilot and you don’t carry any other equipment.

Your comments, messages inspire me to do more.\n\nThe whole ~20minutes Dubai video is the result of 20 sleepless nights. I mean I did sleep but you know :) and finally it was all worth it. \n\nThe most difficult parts were to go through the entire footage and then imagine the video in mind and find songs that fit the video and made the cuts on beats like it was designed for that particular frame. I listened to hundreds of songs and then ended up using few. Used EpidemicSound, Musicbed, Artlist.\n\nCreating INTRO, designing transitions just came up in mind with the flow so it was not that difficult. I made INTRO after the whole video was done, I just listened to 2 songs and used the 2nd one, just got lucky :) I  just listened to the beats and I could imagine the INTRO flowing exactly like this, what you are seeing on your screen.\n\nIt really feels good what I imagine in mind and then actually do more then my expectation.\n\nAt the end, I want to say thank you everyone for  appreciating and sharing ❤️', 'Good', 'Amazing video', 'Best editing', 'Really amazing!

I found a fix for the new update in premiere pro! I replied to someone a few months back but since it’s a reply idk how many will see it and I don’t want this to get lost when it could help others. \n\nAnyway! Here it is! What you gotta do is don't put the base preset on your actual clips now. Instead, put them on an adjustment layer that covers whatever you need to cover (either all twenty frames or just the six for the zooms). Once you've done that, go back to your video clip and change the scale from 100 to 34 (give or take. it might be different depending on if you were previously zoomed. Just make it so it's matching the scale size as the frame before the adjustment layer). Now that that is done, add ANOTHER adjustment layer on top of the the base preset adjust layer and then add whatever transition you want, and boom, it works! (: Cheers! Hope this helps!"", '🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏', 'I have a problem with that! When I apply Zoom in to right video (6 frames) it zooming at 300 and image is big.

I feel like you're one of the few creators who speaks and ignites creativity in their audiences. I know I don't just speak for myself, but you have inspired me over the last couple of years to create with intention - intention for myself and those around me rather than just for pure metrics and views (not that I get a lot of views but that it's not the pure intention of my recent videos). <- hope this wasn't too confusing 😅\n\nI just got back from a 9 month travel trip to 11 different countries, and I have been making 100 videos of my travels (Project 100) starting back in December 2022. I am on video 80, and since the beginning of Project 100, you and a couple other creators were some of the people who inspired me to pursue making these many videos within this time frame. It's funny that you brought up the Artlist Creator fund, as if you had been watching my videos from the start 😂, because for the last month I've been thinking about how to give back to the local people whom I've met during my travels, ones that I've built relationships with in each country I've been to, because when I was in their countries, they showed me and taught me so much about their cultures, even giving me food, gifts, and in some cases, somewhere to stay. I was thinking about reaching out to YesTheory or Mr. Beast (knowing it might not work, but just shooting my shot) to help me give back to them, but I think now I'll pitch it to Artlist and you.\n\nI want to fly out 22 people to the US, people who've helped me in the last 9 months in 11 countries. They cooked me meals, gave me tours, took me on hikes, and even brought me to local, family parties and traditions. I've been so grateful to those people who I might have only met once or twice but treated me like I had known them for a long time, taking a chance to invite a stranger into their lives. Many of these people have never been to the US and are curious about where I'm from. I want to show them, bring them, and introduce them to the things from my life, as they had showed me in their hometowns and countries. \n\nI am going to make a more formal video for the Artlist challenge, but I thought I would just give you a little overview now :)\n\nSorry that this is so long, and you might not be able to see this, but hopefully through the video I make for Artlist. However, I just wanted to show a little of my appreciation for all that you've inspired within me by writing something a little more thorough to give you an idea of how you showed me the opportunity of creativity and the product of what you inspire in your audience."", ""Made it to the end. I would like just to make a documental of how the people lives along the world and how different and similar we are. \n\nAnd i would buy a monitor because i don't see anything in the small screen of my camera\nthanks for everything"", 'Absolutely LOVE this. Been thinking a lot about how to infuse some of the pure passion back into things. I always put off a passion project because I think I have to prioritize the ""helpful"" content I put out for my audience... but the passion projects are truly what connects you to *your people*.', 'I think this concept is HIGHLY underrated. Some additional reasons this is crucial to your creative journey.\n1- You have to create the projects you want to be hired for. These passion projects can become the template for the next client project. Client projects soon become dream, passion projects. (Literally what Sam is doing in the video right now. Artlist is now sponsoring his wild music videos that he definitely made as a passion project)\n2- Passion projects refine your unique style as a creator. Client projects often have too many limitations to really experiment and explore. Passion project have no rules. You are directed by an “inner voice/guiding star” some might say.\n3- A passion project should push your limits. It should have you doubting wether your sane or not. If it’s not pushing you, you will be left feeling unfulfilled because there was no growth- sure you were passionate about the subject and maybe got to play with some new gear you rented, but that’s not enough to get the real benefit from it. \n4- This is an INVESTMENT. I speak from personal experience that all passion projects that I went all out on (including thousands of dollars I really couldn’t afford to spend) have had 5-10x returns in the long run. \n5- All of this will leave you feeling a weight of resistance. Mainly due to the fact that we have been brainwashed to believe that a project is only legitimate with someone paying us a fee, or if it has clear boundaries or expectations. This artlist context will make you feel better about it all cause you could win the 100,000. Trouble is, you shouldn’t be doing it for the money. It should be driven from a much deeper reservoir- merging your passion\nProject with your purpose/ hero’s journey is crucial. (Often having those you love involved will have that effect- so Sam’s point here is valid. \n\nJust stop doubting and go for it. 🙌']"

The stories just here in Namibia are around each and every corner. One of the reasons might be that people who travel to a country can only spend 2 or 3 weeks in a country.

I plan on leaving in march to do this for 6 months going through Asia. wish me luck! and I hope more people get back into it!"", ""Probably going on a small rant over something i chased for years and years. It's obvious that cinematic travel videos are stopping. It costs a lot of money to travel, countless hours of editing to then get a a few views (related obviously to how big your channel is). That is not even the problem, the problem is that you see a shitty video with no quality go viral on something like tiktok/reels. In the same way a video you'll edit in 10 minutes gets way more views than the one you spent days editing. People's attention span is split between a 1000 people giving them 10 seconds each on shorts/tiktok/reels, rather than watching 10 people for a 1000 seconds each. I would have loved to continue my journey, even without views.

In my limited experience, it took me 5 hours of driving to location, over 3 hours to film and 10 hours to edit a cinematic-ish house tour video that turned out to be under 4 minutes long. I am very proud of the video, and it was awesome learning, but as a teacher my day job can be very draining, and I don\'t want to spend that much time making a 3.5 minute long video. I don\'t love IG reels, but the appeal is that even with cinematic filming it could take a fraction of the amount of time and get much more exposure. Its both a push and a pull thing - want to make something in a quicker way and want it to be appreciated when I put it out there. Of course, we should all make things just for us and not ""for social media"", but we also want our art to be appreciated.', 'I do cinematic travel film 😅 and try to implement storytelling.

Zhiyun consistently leads in innovative features that don\'t break the bank, and the WEEBILL S is no exception. It\'s very close in size, weight and ergonomics to the previous WEEBILL, with a few more features like levers and video transmission. In addition you don\'t need to use an app to do major functions, such as auto tuning the motors for your camera / lens combo. I\'ve balanced some pretty massive cameras on this, such as the BMPC6K with the Canon 16-35 lens (I don\'t think this combo is on their list, but I like to push it). The gimbal has no problem keeping up with heavier loads. The innovative design of the new Zhiyun gimbals is to be able to quickly go into low / inverted mode and keep a good grip while doing so. I love this design, it looks a little strange when you first look at it but after using it you won\'t want to go back to a conventional design. At such an affordable price point, I really don\'t see a reason to get a different gimbal, unless you need to carry a massive cinema camera / lens or something (I haven\'t done it yet but I bet I could balance my Canon C200 on this puppy easily.) I would recommend getting another 1/4""-20 handle to always keep screwed into the top handle position, this way you can use the tripod/grip combo and go into low mode without having to make any quick changes.
