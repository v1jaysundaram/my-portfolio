0,NKlp2wuK904,Gawx 2,Los Angeles,"I got to visit Los Angeles once again, since it was a work trip, I only had 3 free days to film around the city. This is the result of it. Had such a great time and got to meet one of my favorite filmmakers, @serr .Hope you enjoy this video as much as I did creating it.

Last year, I watched ""Taste of Cherry"" from Abbas Kiarostami, an incredible film which instantly became one of my favorites. At the end of it, the song ""St. James Infirmary"" by Louis Armstrong is played. Ever since watching that movie, I've wanted to use this song in one of my videos and what better opportunity to do so than Los Angeles. 

As always, if you have any questions let me know and I'll respond to you.

39,Ofq9H_tVuMU,Beautiful Destinations,Our Stay: Greece,"With just 14 days to shoot, we set out to the Greek islands with a goal to bring the famed destination to life like never before. We’d use predominantly FPV to create a thrilling ride through countless locations across Santorini and Mykonos, but without missing out on capturing and conveying the subtle beauty of the culture and people at each location we shot. Our need to travel both wide and deep led us to partner up with Katikies.

All 7 Katikies properties became our revolving home-base for the shoot, not to mention central characters in the resulting film. From sunrise to sunset we’d shoot in the stunning rooms, pools, restaurants, and corridors before diving into the views and setting out to film at nearby locations like Red Beach, Black Beach, Ammoudi, Mykonos Town, or Earth and Water Pottery Studio. Katikies was more than a sanctuary, the hotel and its staff was an expert concierge to truly experiencing the islands, arranging everything from yacht excursions to authentic cavernous wine tastings for us.  

We experienced the magic of Greece all throughout the shooting process and we hope you feel it while watching the video. Look for it in the painted canvas of the intro scene which a local artist painted for us in under 24 hours, and in the violinist at Red Beach who agreed to climb to a peak and play his songs on a more dramatic stage for us, and in the steady hands of potterist Andreas Makaris who never tired of our studio visits to capture one more angle. Thank you for all the magic, Greece!

Hey guys! Sham Ismail here and I’d like to thank you all for watching this travel film.

So many hours have been spent to bring you this short but energetic film. These past few months have been physically and mentally exhausting, but it’s been worth it. I spent time with some amazing people with who I had the pleasure of traveling around Pakistan with.

This film gives you a glimpse into the culture and the scenic landscapes Pakistan has to offer. This visual story takes you on a journey as narratives unfold through the winding mountain passes and chaotic city roads connecting us to the land and its people. Pakistan is a destination not many of us think about when we think adventure, but let this video be a testament to that.

Director's Notes 
(@tomjauncey)

The last few months has been head down focused on directing the launch commercial for Ain and I couldn’t be more proud to share it.

I’ve been wanting to do something with Slow Motion for a while and with the release of the @freeflysystems Wave camera I knew I could come up with something special.

My concept was “Bullet Time” - slowing down moments in time to showcase the vast number of experiences that could be had during a day at Ain and Bluewaters Island.

Now it was about building a team to execute and none of this would have been possible if it hadn’t been for the incredible work from each of these guys.

We had @43lens on the FPV drone. We upped our game in a big way using the @catalystmachine Money Shot Mini, which allowed us to put the Wave cinema camera on a custom built drone. Love Paras took this challenge on and delivered some exceptional aerial work executing a number of Dubai firsts.

@ferrufilms took on the cinematics and hero edit. His professionalism & attention to detail was exceptional. Shooting on the Wave & Canon C70, Jacob was able to nail the very different compositions and styles that each scene required.

@itsprestonchen took on the supporting cinematics and mastered the VFX. Preston created the underwater sequence, inspired by an Apple commercial, and I think he did it better!

@shravanraoo supported Preston on the VFX creating the @dubaiholding cloud transition which sets the tone for the video in a truly wow factor way.

So much more went into this with lots of sleepless nights getting this done but it was the #BDTeam spirit and energy that got us through it all. Couldn’t be more proud of the team!

Thank you Dubai Holding & Ain Dubai for trusting in us and letting us get creative 😉.

42,3JSOOPWbRVc,Beautiful Destinations,Cage Diving with Great Whites | Shark Attack Survivor Story,"""They're not crazy man-eaters but are beautiful creatures in our ocean that we should protect and look after.""

Despite encountering an attack by a great white shark in 1963, Rodney Fox didn't stop exploring the oceans. Instead of letting fear paralyze him, he let his fascination push him forward, going so far as to building the first-ever underwater shark observation cage and pioneering shark cage diving. Today, he has dedicated over 50 years of his life to shark conservation, continuing his mission of giving sharks a voice, redefining the public perception of sharks, and advocating for their protection.

Filmmaker Elliot Grafton had the honor of meeting Rodney Fox and his team, setting out on a 4-day expedition in South Australia's Neptune Islands to capture footage of great whites and gaining wisdom from the shark-attack-survivor-turned-conservationist himself.

44,pQAi1IU-ajc,Beautiful Destinations,Georgia From Above,"Hey guys! My name is Love Paras and I am a FPV pilot based in Dubai. 

You know what is crazy? Exactly 15 months ago, I came across the Beautiful Destinations Turkey FPV video & fell in love with the way everything was captured using a FPV drone. I even remember showing the video to my colleagues at a 9-5 job that I was working at. This inspired me to quit my job (a year back) to pursue being a full-time creator. I always had a vision to travel to a country and capture the best spots only using a FPV drone. 

An opportunity to travel to Georgia came up last month and I suddenly saw my vision coming to life. I am super grateful to Tom Jauncey for pushing me every single day & helping me put this video together in the best way possible.
 
Before visiting I didn't know much about the country but was blown away by it's rich culture, heritage and cuisine. Tbilisi is where I spent most of my time but then ventured out into the mountains by car. 

For the budget conscious traveler Georgia is 100% the place for you.

Thank you so much for this opportunity & to many more! I hope you all like Georgia From Above - 43lens.

45,Qy4RhouqS-I,Beautiful Destinations,Let's Go The Emirates,"Over the years the Beautiful Destinations Team has been to the Emirates many times. However, we’ve only ever explored Dubai & Abu Dhabi. For our first trip of 2021 we’ve decided to come to the Emirates to show you something a little different. 

You’ve all seen the futuristic skylines of Dubai & Abu Dhabi but have you ever seen the great outdoors of the Emirates? 

This was shot across Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, Fujairah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai as the #BDTeam explored the mountains, deserts, beaches and waters of the country. There are so many hidden gems in the Emirates.There’s truly something for everyone, making the UAE the #WorldsCoolestWinter.

46,EiaNkEDlUFw,Beautiful Destinations,Let's Go - Tulum,"Over the last few years Tulum, Mexico has become one of today's most sought-after destinations. From its pristine beaches, to its Mayan Ruins, to endless amounts of cenotes and caves. The destination really is for everyone, whether you want to relax, explore or adventure. 

On doing our research of the destination we felt there wasn't a go to cinematic video that truly represented the vibe of the place and showcased all of Tulum's natural beauty. So we decided to partner up with our friends at #DJI to try and create the definitive visual guide to #Tulum. We've included a behind the scenes ""Getting The Shot"" at the end of this video in an effort to show you our creative process, how our team executes on the ground and the suite of DJI products that we used.

I hope, even after the pandemic, we continue this attitude.” 2020 has been a year of change for travel, but the Philippines is excited to invite visitors back to the beautiful islands. We worked with a team of local creators to highlight the diverse offerings in the Philippines, as well as speak to locals about their experience during the pandemic. 

The opportunities for exploration in the Philippines are endless—from the Hundred Island National Park in Pangasinan to exploring the Suba and Culili Sand Dunes in Ilocos Norte.

49,IvrUTGiTFA0,Beautiful Destinations,Diwali - The Indian Festival of Lights,"Today we’re excited to do a throwback to 2016 when we had Sam Kolder filming this Beautiful Destinations Original in India.

Diwali is India’s biggest and most important holiday of the year, observed by more than a billion people across faiths. Known as the Festival of Lights, it is a 5-day celebration bringing prayer, feasts, fireworks, family gatherings and, for some, a new year. Derived from the Sanskrit ""dipavali"", which means “row of lights,” Diwali is known for the brightly burning clay lamps that celebrants line up outside their homes to cherish the victory of good over evil.

With this year’s coronavirus pandemic affecting the celebration, may we be able to derive comfort from the spirit of the holiday—the belief that, eventually, light will triumph over darkness.

50,960RObhrg2Y,Beautiful Destinations,"Praia Da Ursa, Portugal","What’s In Your Backyard is a celebration of the beautiful local spots that are within driving distance of your home. Given 2020 has been a year of change for travel, Beautiful Destinations wants to put a local spotlight on our community, their homes and show that travel is as much about exploring the hidden gems around you as it is venturing somewhere foreign. We gave the BD community a challenge: to show us what's in their backyard using just their phones and drones. We are proud to present our winner, Diogo Bras with Praia da Ursa.


DIRECTOR'S NOTES:
""Hey guys! Diogo Bras here. I am a Portuguese Creative Producer/Filmmaker and I'm blown away to have this incredible opportunity that seemed like a dream to me. 

I started my journey as a filmmaker over a year ago and until now I'm just filming with my phone. Everyday I work on improving my skills and I had a lot of failures. Failures to myself and not being able to create what I wanted. But I had some wins and the best win of all was this one.

What's In Your Backyard was a challenge from Beautiful Destinations and when I saw it, I didn't think twice. I called some friends and we explored our own backyard with just a phone a drone. 

Praia da Ursa is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It really surprised me to see a place like it in Portugal. I didn't have to catch an airplane to see the most beautiful beach I ever saw. If you explore your own backyards, with your family or your friends, you will without doubt discover a paradise in a place that's always been close to you."" - Diogo Bras

51,v3-10wKbDYk,Beautiful Destinations,Ghana - The Golden Return,"Director's Notes:
Hey Guys - Clé Hunnigan and Barnabas Kelemen here - a Director/DP duo based in London.

The Ghana story was very important and timely for us to tell when we did. Though originally from Jamaica/Cayman Islands, I did a DNA test to find out that my roots were from Ghana. The sentiment of 'home' and 'being comfortable in your skin' became especially symbolic for me and coincided with ""The Year of The Return"" in 2019 - Ghana's own national initiative which commemorated 400 years since the first African slaves touched down in the US and an invitation for people from the African Diaspora to return and connect with their cultural heritage. I took my first trip to Ghana in Dec 2019 to celebrate The Year of The Return with The Wind Collective Community and felt instantly at one with the culture there. There was something special about being in a place where you could truly be yourself. I ended up staying for 5 weeks to document, shoot and bring this story to life with one of my best friends and creative partners - Barni, and so the film - ""The Golden Return"" was born.

From highlighting the first Sub-Saharan African country to gain independence - to showcasing the youth and a rich history, this film is about celebrating blackness, getting intimate and up close with Ghanaian culture and reclaiming the narrative of what the mainstream media claims Africa is. We hope you enjoy the vibrancy, energy and perspective of how we experienced Ghana. I hope it reminds you - that people are what make a place and invites you to travel “deeper” in order to find what makes us all truly human. As one of the lines in the film says - “Home isn’t just where you are. It is who you are - and here, you can be yourself.”

52,8-t-NBgRvQc,Beautiful Destinations,The Cocos (Keeling) Islands,"DIRECTOR'S NOTES:
Hey guys! My name is Jaxon Roberts and for the past few years I have been pursuing my dream of becoming a filmmaker and photographer. Since the beginning of my career, I always dreamt of capturing mind blowing locations that people haven’t yet seen before. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands,  fits this description perfectly. Haven’t heard of it? Neither have I until a couple of years ago! And it’s part of Australia (where I’ve lived my whole life!).

Located off the coast of Western Australia, this once coconut palm plantation is now just a tropical paradise with stunning beaches and deep jungles that you have to see to believe. Cocos consists of 27 islands, only 2 of which are inhabited.

Back in December of 2019, I was lucky enough to travel here with a bunch of other creative minded people . Lucky for us, we have friends that grew up on these islands and could show us all they have to offer. From camping on our own island under the stars and amongst hundreds of hermit crabs to swimming in the clearest water you’ve ever seen, eating freshly caught and cooked fish and drinking fresh coconuts, this experience was something I once only ever dreamt of. Whilst filming this paradise I had 2 goals: to take in and embrace the simplistic island life and to portray the true essence of our experience. I came home with some of my favorite footage I’ve ever captured and I'm so happy I can share it all! Thanks for watching, your support means the world to me!

53,0wRdtesn0_Q,Beautiful Destinations,Spider-Man: Be A Hero,"Director’s Notes

September 12th, 2020: four days before the launch of the GoPro Hero 9 and thanks to my friends at Adorama I get my hands on the highly anticipated new camera. The adrenaline is pumping as I know the next few days are going to be intense but that’s what I live for, a passion for creating.

In 2 days of shooting and 1 day of editing the goal is to turn around something that captures the attention of the world as GoPro releases their new camera. I love setting stretch goals and pushing the boundaries but this is going to be a challenge!

As I write this out it makes me laugh, that during quarantine I became Spider-Man. What started as a fun and quirky video during lockdown developed into something so much more. My Spider-Man videos have now generated over 25 Million views across Social Media and helped drive $125,000 for charity. So when Adorama approached me about the GoPro Hero 9, it was an obvious choice to bring Spider-Man back to life. 

I liked the positioning of taking GoPro’s slogan quite literally, #BeAHero, and coming up with something original that would suit the style of the camera and show others what they could do with the product. In this case I wanted to create a high energy, in your face video that would merge first person POV with FPV, two things that GoPro have become synonymous with. 

Despite my work and life revolving around Social Media, through Beautiful Destinations, I actually look elsewhere for my inspiration. Movies are what get me excited and I always love the concept of taking something that was done in film and translating that to the smaller screen. In this case I had Guy Ritchies’ quick cut editing style in mind and Matthew Vaughn’s Kickass/Kingsmen action scenes as the inspiration. 

For me, new equipment is always an opportunity to try something different. I love challenging myself to push a product to it’s breaking point, that’s when you really know if the product is going to be a regular in your camera bag. The GoPro Hero 9 certainly will be!

54,-vW_F92SnHc,Beautiful Destinations,The Mermaid & the Gardener,"Cosmic mystery, a space of wonder, celestial beauty, and unimaginable vastness...that covers most of our own planet. Seven-tenths of the Earth’s surface is ocean, yet the vast majority of it remains a mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of the moon than we do the bottom of the ocean — our own blue universe that surrounds and sustains us all. Our Planet needs healthy oceans; it’s time to turn things around. 

In the last three decades, half of the world’s coral reefs have died and if we don’t act now, those ocean treasures will be completely gone by 2050. It would be the destruction of an entire ecosystem, and with it, ourselves.

Coral reef extinction profoundly impacts all species from marine life to human kind. We must be the generation to solve issues our oceans are facing. If we save our reefs we are one step closer to sustaining life on earth.

55,YExFxMfy_Co,Beautiful Destinations,Australia's Secret Paradise,"DIRECTORS NOTES:
Hey everyone. Elliot Grafton here.
I am a filmmaker/photographer from Australia.

I spent some time exploring my own backyard the past few weeks, and it has blown me away. I think sometimes people forget to appreciate the areas they call home. Itʼs easy to do, we get so caught up in daily life, the idea of escaping to somewhere far away becomes so romantic. But really I think the root of our dissatisfaction with staying local comes down to inattention.

If you take even a second to really look at how beautiful your own backyard is, the native flora & fauna... where else will you ever find that? To showcase the beauty in local travel, all you really need to do is be present.

56,WhlSuRbliPs,Beautiful Destinations,Cairo: A New Era,"Directors Note:
Hey everyone. Matias De Rada here.
This was such a unique story that I was able to tell during my time in Egypt. For many years, the artistic culture has not been able to get much recognition resulting in most artists working in silence. This story is a look into how a group of musicians are innovating within a genre of music called ""Mahraganat"" which originated in underprivileged neighborhoods of Cairo, but is now getting the attention of the entire country.

This film is dedicated to any creative out there who intends on carving out their own path no matter the circumstances and who at the same time looks to utilize their skills to push out positivity and optimism. I hope this film inspires you all to see any challenge in the field you are interested in as an opportunity to grow fond of the process knowing that as long as we don’t attach ourselves to the outcome, we will end up enduring much of the hardships that cause many people to give up.

57,m2mdZw7PvcI,Beautiful Destinations,What's In Your Backyard?,"Today we’re kicking off an exciting community campaign called “What’s In Your Backyard?” where you’ll have the chance to win a weekend getaway for you and a friend. 

Click on the link below to enter:
http://bit.ly/YourBackyard

What’s In Your Backyard is a celebration of the beautiful local spots that are within driving distance of your home. For many of us, Travel is associated with hopping on a flight and going somewhere completely foreign. However, there is local beauty in every corner of the world that currently can be captured safely and responsibly. Given 2020 has been a year of change for Travel, Beautiful Destinations wants to put a local spotlight on our community, their homes and show that Travel is as much about exploring the hidden gems around you as it is venturing somewhere foreign.

Our community is built up of creative talent from all over the world. In an effort to feature more of you across our channels we’d love to see you make a 2-3 minute video in the same style as this “What’s In Your Backyard?”.

Your video submission should be solely using a phone and a drone. The goal here is for anyone to be able to make it with the device that’s in their pocket. If you don’t have a drone then a fully mobile video is absolutely fine. This mobile focus will give the video a POV (point of view) style. We’d recommend you mix in multiple perspectives and angles of each location and experience, focusing on quicker cut editing.

The mobile style and voiceover is meant to make the piece more relatable and achievable for the everyday traveler. Drone content adds further wow factor and helps establish the destination but again, this is not essential.

Your video should be brought to life through a voice over narration. Think of it as a reflective “storytime” piece of content that focuses on a wow factor local destination or experience that is close to your home. One way of looking at this is to imagine you were explaining that “must do or must visit” location or experience to a friend, that’s never heard of or been there. 

How would you get them excited about visiting and experiencing that place? Think about keeping the content engaging, fun and adding value or insight.

Let’s see what you’ve got!

58,Nw4onZcDzDc,Beautiful Destinations,The Perfect Shot,"DIRECTORS NOTES:
Hey everyone, Sam Newton here. 

This was a pretty special film for me to put together. Not only is it a collection of some of my favorite shots from my all around the world, it also showcases some of my favorite memories with other creatives who I am lucky enough to call my friends. This piece is an ode to all photographers and videographers that don’t just sit around and wait to be inspired, but actually get up and go. Being a travel photographer/videographer is a job that takes a very specific type of person, someone who is borderline obsessive and dedicated to his or her craft, but it is a truly rewarding profession that has given me a true reason to live, and I believe with the right amount of crazy its a life anyone can have. I hope this connects with a few of you, and hopefully is the spark you need to grab your camera, get outside, and go chase your not so perfect shot.

59,x4JSjyxP2x4,Beautiful Destinations,Sunset Sounds with CloZee,"There’s a strong relationship between Music & Travel. Both transport people physically or emotionally, are sources of comfort and wonder, and provide connection with others and with oneself. The two go hand in hand.

However right now we can’t fully experience either of them as we used to. Now more than ever people are looking for moments of happiness.

We believe that Music & Travel can come together as a way to bring about more moments of happiness. Beautiful Destinations has always focused on making a positive impact. We transform destinations, change perceptions and spread feel good content that people actively search out. By combining music with a beautiful backdrop we believe we can spark some joy back into the world.
Let’s make those travel moments and music experiences virtual, as music transports you.

60,fSVQkF3T904,Beautiful Destinations,"Pebble Mine, Alaska","Bristol Bay, one of Alaska’s most treasured natural wonders, is under threat. It’s home to an irreplaceable ecosystem and one of the last salmon strongholds. Not only that, its iconic wildlife has sprung up a sustainable tourism industry which effects thousands of Alaskan livelihoods.

All of this is under threat if the Pebble Mine moves forward. The recent approval of the environmental impact statement has made it clear that our voices need to be heard. 

Nature and people can’t live without fresh water, and Bristol Bay is the lifeblood that sustains every species calling the region home. On a recent trip to Alaska, the #BDTeam and WWF Ambassador, Jeremy Jauncey, learned firsthand about the conservation community’s fight against Pebble Mine.

TAKE ACTION:
Tell EPA to VETO the Pebble Mine.

Despite the threat of a mining disaster in Bristol Bay, Pebble Mine permitting has been rushed through at record speed. The final environmental review for Pebble Mine was released on July 23 2020 and the US Army Corps can issue a record of decision and permit the mine after 30 days. Now is the time to make our opposition to Pebble Mine heard. 

Call the EPA Regional Director Chris Hladick and Alaskan Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and tell them to do everything in their power to push the EPA to veto the Pebble Mine.

The EPA has a responsibility to protect Bristol Bay communities and must veto the Pebble Mine.

61,9WWi8ca8Hig,Beautiful Destinations,"Holika - Varanasi, India","Last March, Kevin Clerc (also known as Face Du Monde) had the chance to celebrate Holi festival in Varanasi, India. Located on the left bank of the Ganges river, the city of Varanasi is considered one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and probably the holiest city in India.

Also known as the Hindu celebration of colors, Holi festival is celebrated every year by millions of people who throw pigments of color at each other's faces.

Originally Holi festival celebrated the fertility of the land, today the participants rejoice for the abundant crops and the defeat of evil.

Holika was a demoness in Hindu Vedic scriptures, who was burnt to death with the help of God Vishnu. The story of Holika Dahan (Holika's death) signifies the triumph of good over evil. Holika is associated with an annual bonfire on the night before Holi.

62,zBtvesLJNqA,Beautiful Destinations,The Oaxacan Chemist,"The city and municipality of Oaxaca de Juárez, or Oaxaca City, is located in the foothills of the Sierra Madre at the base of the Cerro del Fortín, and extending to the banks of the Atoyac River in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Heritage tourism makes up an important part of the city's economy, and with its colonial-era architecture, important archeological sites, delicious cuisine, and a beautiful art scene we can understand why so many people travel here. Yet beyond these great aspects, the reason that the #BDTeam traveled to Oaxaca City was to explore the culture around mezcal. 

Oaxaca City is the capital of mezcal, and you could say that this drink is one of the world’s most complex and misunderstood liquors. Most people know that it’s made from the agave plant, just like Tequila, but did you know that Tequila is just one type of mezcal? Tequila is produced in only approved regions and only from a specific species of plant. In contrast to that, mezcal can be made from several other agave species which allows flavors to vary widely, from smoky and honeyed to grassy and peppery! The history of the drink is incredibly interesting and we hope this video encourages you to travel here someday and learn more.

The state of Oaxaca sponsors the International Mezcal Festival which is usually held every year here in Oaxaca City. During the festival, locals and tourists can sample and buy a large variety of mezcals.

64,GQ7O5j7ro_I,Beautiful Destinations,Australia - Adventure on the East Coast,"Last December Benn TK was invited on a trip down the East coast of Australia organized by Australian tour company Welcome To Travel. Benn is from Australia but he'd never explored the east coast before and couldn't believe how beautiful his home was. It didn't feel like the Australia he knew at all, but something much, much more. So rich in wildlife and bursting with nature. His journey was accompanied by 25 other fun and energetic people from Mexico on their mid-semester break from University in Melbourne. Having never met any of these people before, Benn and the others traveled from the tropical state of Queensland, visiting the world's largest coral reef, The Great Barrier Reef. And then venturing to some of the whitest and finest sand beaches in existence, the Whitsundays, with sand so fine it could polish jewelry. As the group traveled further down the coast, the adventures and laughter within the group grew. Strong friendships and valuable memories formed. The few last days of the journey were spent in Fraser Island, a famous island known for its long sandy beaches and hidden untouched swimming holes in the middle of the forests and desert areas. Fraser Island is also home to some incredible wildlife, Dingoes, Kangaroos, echidnas, and the giant lace monitor lizards. This trip began during last year's tragic wildfires, spreading through Australia. Benn and the group experienced the smoke and flames while driving around the sand beaches on the island, seeing the power and potential the fire had to cause massive destruction to the wildlife. Fortunately, the group was in safe hands as the fire could not reach the beach. Even though Benn was tasked with the job to capture this amazing adventure, this trip reminded him of why he left everything behind to start traveling in the first place. Making unforgettable friends, creating unique memories, and most importantly, incredible stories to tell the world.

This is where the Great Plains meet the epic Rocky Mountains. So if you’ve ever wanted to explore a destination where nature abounds, then this is the place for you! 

Head to Jackson if you want to explore the iconic Grand Teton National Park or the world-class skiing offered in Jackson Hole. Plus there is also the nearby National Elk Refuge if you’d like to see some wildlife! The #BDTeam really loved Yellowstone National Park. While it is famous for Old Faithful Geyser, it also offers stunning canyons, lush forests, racing rivers, and hot springs! 

We usually talk about warm destinations when we think of vacations but what do you think of Wyoming in the winter? No matter what activities you participate in here, it is sure to be an adventure!

66,db7h8qXGx50,Beautiful Destinations,"The Hunt - Florence, Italy","June is one of the best months to find yourself in Florence for many reasons. One of the main reasons you should visit during this time is to see the Calcio Storico Fiorentino. This extraordinary event is a combination of soccer, rugby, and wrestling. It originated in 16th century Florence and is played today in historical costume. The four teams of the historical neighborhoods of the city play against each other, first in two semi-finals and then the final match to determine the winner. 

Piazza Santa Croce, located directly in front of the church Santa Croce, has always been the home to this game. The square is covered in dirt to commemorate a time long ago when the square was just dirt rather than stone as it is today. Bleachers are set up so that spectators can better enjoy the game and have a view of the action.

The whole city turns out to enjoy the spectacle for Calcio Storico is not just a sporting event but a celebration of Florence!

Last year several members of the #BDTeam traveled to Florence for Calcio Storico. Even though the games are not being held this June we want to pay tribute to the history and tradition of this unique sporting event. Is there something special to your home or area that differentiates it or is significant to you? Let us know in the comments!

68,Ilui-mb3sT0,Beautiful Destinations,Vietnam - From Above,"Several months ago the #BDTeam spun a globe and got on a flight to Vietnam in less than 24 hours. With them was Alex Adrian Lopez Rios who captured the trip from above with an FPV Drone. 

Vietnam is a traveler’s dream. Ride a scooter along the busy streets of Hanoi, try paragliding in Hoành Bồ, sleep on a traditional boat on Hạ Long Bay, and experience the beautiful culture that this country offers. 

The #BDTeam recommends taking an overnight journey to one of Vietnam’s most impressive natural sights - Ban Gioc Waterfall. The falls occur on the Quay Son River, a beautiful jade-blue body of water flowing from China through a pastoral landscape of rice fields and bamboo groves surrounded by limestone pinnacles. 

Another very unique experience was cruising along Ha Long Bay. With 3,000 limestone and dolomite islets sprinkled over an area of 1,500 square kilometers, Ha Long Bay offers a wonderland of karst topography. In recognition of this, in 1994, Ha Long Bay was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

If you travel to the northernmost region of Vietnam, you will find Ha Giang. A remote destination that has been open to tourism for only a few years. The region boasts nature as you’ve never seen it. Massive limestone walls, granite outcrops everywhere, hanging valleys, rice terraces climbing to the clouds, and winding roads carved into the mountainsides. This alone sounds like a great adventure, but combined with the ubiquitous presence of the local hill tribes—mostly proud Black Hmong—this experience is a ""must-do"" on any Vietnam itinerary. 

From the capital city to the most remote part of Vietnam, this is a beautiful destination that will create lasting memories for any travelers. Have you visited Vietnam yet? Let us know what you think in the comments!

The deepest gorge in France, Gorges du Verdon, is one of the must-see natural wonders of central Provence. It is an easy day trip from the French Riviera, however, we recommend staying in the area for a couple of days because it has so much to offer. 

The opportunities for adventure are endless. There are over 1500 incredible routes for rock climbers. For the very experienced, like Mich Kemeter, you may choose to go base jumping from the high altitudes of the mountain tops. For a more relaxed time, kayaking or boating into the lower part of the gorge is a very popular activity. Or hike to explore Gorges du Verdon and take photos. No matter how you spend your time, you can guarantee that it will be the trip of a lifetime. Had you heard of the Gorges du Verdon before? Let us know what you think in the comments!

Hey everyone. Kyle Vollaers here. 
Last year I had the pleasure of traveling around Sri Lanka for two months and got to fully immerse myself in the natural beauty and culture of this incredible country. From the monumental views of Sigiriya Rock to the rolling tee fields of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka left me speechless every day.  

After Sri Lanka went through such a huge tragedy last year, it was truly inspiring to experience so much positivity and hospitality from the local people. I am very much looking forward to returning to Sri Lanka once we can all travel again, and I really hope you make the trip out to this spectacular place yourself.

72,ubVWxQIuh8g,Beautiful Destinations,New Zealand Winter,"DIRECTOR'S NOTES: 
What’s up everyone!

My name is Ben Mikha, a filmmaker and photographer from New Zealand who has been working for Beautiful Destinations over the last year. A lot of you will be heading into summer in the coming months but down here in New Zealand we are about to enter winter. A season I once struggled with until I took a trip around my home which changed everything. I fell in love with everything winter has to offer, the snow, the mountains, the frozen lakes, and my personal favorite, the night sky! 

I wanted to share these moments with you at a time when our planet is faced with a global crisis to remind you of how beautiful our home is. Even though times may be tough as we’re presented with a lot of uncertainty, I believe cultivating a positive mindset is what will help us all bounce back better than ever. With travel being out for a little while, I wanted to take you on a virtual tour across my home, a place where I find peace and solitude amongst nature. Most of all though, I hope this inspires you to see more of your backyard, whether a city or a national park, there’s always beauty to be found. Step out of your comfort zone, try something new, and invite new experiences. For me this was journeying into the mountains during the peak of winter which lead me to a newfound love for summers cooler sibling.

Thanks for hanging out!

Hey everyone! Clare Thurkett here.
I filmed and edited this video late last year at a time where everyone was traveling and making memories with their friends. Being in today's climate and looking back now, I’m so happy and grateful with how I was able to spend my time in Iceland. 

I wasn’t as focused on capturing the destination, rather I was trying to capture the raw moments with my friends. I knew this trip wasn't exactly going to be smooth sailing with all the craziness that comes with putting 6 people into a small RV. But the adventures of getting lost multiple times, running out of gas, and not knowing how to drive manual, all led us to be closer as friends. We are all pretty nostalgic right now but I am also so excited for the future when we can travel again. Tell us about a crazy travel experience you’ve had in the comments.

74,BapSQFJPMM0,Beautiful Destinations,Let's Go - Egypt,"DIRECTOR’S NOTES:
Last year in 2019 the Beautiful Destinations team traveled around Egypt for three weeks capturing the entire country. BD team member Jake Irish and I (Chris Shepherd) traveled through the eastern part of the country while our teammates Ben Mikha and Cory Martin split off to explore the western part of the country. 

Jake and I started in Aswan and sailed up the Nile River to Luxor where we saw ancient temples and artifacts that I had only read about growing up. We then traveled east to the Red Sea where the water was turquoise blue and crystal clear; it was not surprising that it has some of the best scuba diving in the world. We finished our journey in the Sinai Peninsula where the hospitality of the local Bedouins greeted us at every turn and the rugged mountains and vast desert landscapes took our breath away. At the same time Ben and Cory traveled where we could not in Alexandria, Siwa, Fayoum, the Black Desert, and the White Desert. We could not have done any of this without our local guide Ahmed Wahba who may or may not have slept the entire trip to get us the shots we needed. 

Although Egypt is known for the Pyramids, the country was much more diverse and the eclectic landscapes we encountered made it my favorite travel destination. I hope this video captures how incredible Egypt truly is!

75,__lYWslv7W4,Beautiful Destinations,Botswana’s Okavango Delta - Heaven on Earth,"DIRECTOR’S NOTES:

Hey! Antoine Janssens here. Since I was a kid I’ve been fascinated by the wildlife around us. I watch a lot of wildlife documentaries and the beauty that they display still shocks me all the time. 

The vision that I have about this sensitive topic is quite simple:
 « Look at the beauty of this animal evolving in the wild. We must protect it if we want our children to see it the way we do. » 

People protect what they love. 

The goal of this movie is to show the beauty of the Okavango Delta and the magnificence of these species living their best life in the wild. And honestly, it's also good to see a place where humans don't have control over it. 

I hope this movie will touch you deep in your heart (or just a little bit it’s quite ok 🙂). Let me know what you think in the comments, I’ll be there!

And finally THANK YOU VERY MUCH @Beautifuldestinations for making this possible!

76,liekG77FQvQ,Beautiful Destinations,Under a Mongolian Sky,"DIRECTORS NOTES:
A whisper in the wind, a silence in the stars. Western Mongolia contained a humble beauty, a powerful vastness that’s lure only strengthened as time went on. Nainoa and I (I being Sam Potter) spent two weeks in the province of Bayan-Olgii getting to know the Kazakh eagle hunters who call these lands home. Every day started with the soft blue glow of dawn on our window, the rattle of a bitter wind trying to force its way in, and the fleeting moment of courage it took to remove oneself from the warm bundle of animal skins that made up our beds on the floor. Of course, that was nothing compared to the walk to the outhouse, or for that matter, being in the outhouse, which was four almost waist-high walls surrounding a hole in the ground. Here you’d walk out onto a plank of wood, pop a squat, and decide whether to stick your head up into the icy wind and away from the stench, or hunker down in the sweet sweet smell of warmth. I usually chose warmth, however, Nainoa said he preferred to brave the cold. After that, we’d saddle up and head off into the snow-capped countryside, from this point there are 100 stories I could tell you. Stories of snowstorms and wolves, adventures and eagle hunts, and of deliriousness and hysterical behavior. But the one I’d like to share, although a bit meek in comparison, holds great importance for both myself and the film. After a very long and very cold day, the sun was just starting to set as we returned home. Nainoa and I dismounted our horses and stumbled into the house after our host Esker. The fire was warm, the milk tea was hot, and the house was alive with the hustle and bustle of a mother's work. The young eagle huntresses, Igerim and Igerkh, had been with us shooting all day but were quick to shed their fur coats and help their mother. Nainoa and I were commanded to sit and drink our tea, but soon Nainoa Snuck off to upload footage, and I quietly started peeling potatoes. Tonight Aklut (Esker the eagle hunter’s wife) along with their 4 daughters were preparing a very important and delicious traditional dish, dumplings, and they were freaking amazing, but the reason this night was so special wasn’t because of the dumplings, but because of the friendships that were born. Barriers Were broken and true personalities came out. We laughed, played silly games and had staring contests. We cracked jokes, shared music, and ended up turning this quiet little brick house tucked far away amongst the Altai mountains into a full-blown dance party. These kinds of nights are the heart of everything to me, they’re why I do what I do, and they’re also the moments I’ll never be able to adequately share... no amount of words or cameras can capture them, and distracting myself with trying would be a shame. They’re little rays of pure light that shine through and remind me that we’re all connected, that we can communicate without ever speaking the same language and we can love someone we don't even know. I like to think that these moments are at the heart of our films, that although they can never be captured, they can be felt, that they guide, shape, and direct the stories we tell. Esker said to us at the end of the night that “we are good tourists, and that he knows we traveled far, but he hopes we come back one day, in the summer, and when we have families of our own”.

With very little knowledge, this follows their adventure as they learn more about the industry and work with organizations that have vowed to protect and preserve the Leuser Ecosystem as well as the orangutans that live peacefully under it. They realize that the choices we make back home affect the impact on the other side of the globe.

81,kl28cbwSq5U,Beautiful Destinations,Life in the Arctic Circle - Northern Norway,"DIRECTOR’S NOTES:
Antoine Janssens here. I am the writer, director and filmmaker of ""Life in the Arctic Circle - Northern Norway""

I’m a 29 year old movie director, photographer and storyteller. I’m extremely passionate about sharing positive messages through emotional content. I’ve been fortunate to travel the world and experience it’s diversity. Meeting different cultures, people and experiencing the richness of wildlife, nature and untouched places.

LIFE IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
This movie is something that I’ve wanted to do for a long time. The North and everything up there fascinates me. Especially during the winter season. Huge untouched landscapes, rough weather that constantly changes, rich wildlife and people who live through this daily.

In February 2019 I went with my girlfriend to northern Norway to spend a few days there. I couldn't resist the urge to film everything I saw. There was so much beauty up in the Arctic.

When I got home, I saw the potential of my footage and knew there was more that I could do with it. However, I was missing key elements that could turn this into a story. A few months later, I returned to the same place to complete what I had already created. But this time with very concrete content and story ideas. For this trip I was accompanied by my good friend
Florian Fatton, who is a great photographer, and Michel Janssens (my dad), who like me loves the Nordic culture.

Creating content up there is unique. Everything is beautiful (landscapes, lights etc ...) but it’s not easy. It’s dark almost all of the time in winter. We only had 2 hours of real light per day!

This movie is a short story about a man from the Sami tribe who’s lived up there for his entire life. It's also the first video of a series of others that I’m working on... ☺

83,8MvdnxtbCtA,Beautiful Destinations,AMAZON WARRIORS | By Sam Potter and Nainoa Langer | Beautiful Destinations,"DIRECTOR’S NOTES: 
Hello, my name is Sam Potter, and I am the host, writer, and director of this series of short films on Beautiful Destinations Youtube channel. For me, our latest film, “Amazon Warriors,” is a project that started when I was a child growing up on the island of Kauai. My brothers and I would go camp in the woods or at the beach with no food or water and play what we called “survivors.” We’d imagine we were far far away from civilization, from the comfort of our beds and the safety of our parents. We would build shelters, find water, set traps (that never worked), hunt, and gather fruits to eat. Sometimes if we found a place that we really liked, we’d even try to cultivate the land and further build on the dream of a life lived in the natural world. However, this was just a game. Food, shelter, tv, mom, and dad were never too far away, but the Amazon Rainforest, in our eyes, was where this dream was a reality. A place where people somehow lucked into skipping out on this whole modern world thing. Where kids like us didn’t have to go to school, learn math, or grow up and get a job. In the Amazon, adventure was around every corner, giant trees, snakes, jaguars, and people living amongst it all. Uncontacted, undisturbed, what a life we thought.

I’m 23 years old now, I’m a (borderline) adult, so I’d like to think I’ve matured a little since then. At least enough to understand that I wasn’t about to walk into some Avatar-like utopia hidden away amongst the dense greens of the Amazon basin. I could now enter this mysterious world with no expectations, just a thirst for knowledge, for a taste of what living in the Amazon is really like.

Nevertheless, throughout the process of making this film, I could feel my younger self tugging excitedly at the bottom of my shirt. He was with me every time we had to get out to push the boat upriver. He was there for every snake encounter, and through every minute spent with the people who have called the Amazon home for thousands of years. Tugging at my shirt, wide-eyed and yelling at me, “This is it!”, “This is everything we dreamed of!” “I told you!! I told you this place exists…”. He was also there for every realization of the suffering and pain the modern world has pushed onto the people of the Amazon. The younger me was silenced by the cold reality of our world, heartbroken and confused. 

Creating “Amazon Warriors” was a hell of an adventure that led us to the frontlines of a powerful story of Indigenous resilience. And I’m glad I didn’t only see it through my eyes but through the eyes of an over-excited child.
As you see in the film, the Waorani people won a major lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government which protects 500,000 acres of the Waorani's rainforest territory. However the fight is not over, there’s now major momentum to defend 7 million more acres of indigenous lands threatened by the same oil auction. The Waorani are now in the process of deepening alliances with neighboring indigenous nations to forge a unified movement for the protection of the south-central Ecuadorian Amazon from oil.

86,X2UWx8hCXXw,Beautiful Destinations,THE MAGICIAN | EL MAGO | By Matias De Rada | Beautiful Destinations,"The inspiring story of Daisel Cabriada Díaz, a young boxer in Havana, Cuba who follows his true calling to become a magician.
 
DIRECTOR’S NOTES
Cory Martin and I decided to go to Cuba on a whim. We had just wrapped another Beautiful Destinations project, and we had never been to Cuba. I suggested spending the weekend there before heading back to the office in New York on Monday. On our first day in Havana, we heard Daisel listening to hip hop music right outside a boxing gym. Since I love to dance myself, I approached him and started dancing with him. Right off the bat we were able to communicate through dance and I felt a deeper connection to him. As soon as we stopped dancing, he randomly pulled out a deck of cards and started to perform magic tricks. To our surprise, he was an extremely talented magician as well. 
 
After speaking to Daisel for thirty minutes, and asking him questions about his journey with magic, I said to Cory, “We should come back and tell his story.” 
 
Three months later we both were able to find a week within our travel schedules to go back to Cuba, and attempt to bring Daisel’s story to life. 
 
Due to the lack of Internet in Cuba, it was a shot in the dark if Daisel would be able to meet us and if he would be passionate about the vision I had in mind for the film. I was so surprised by how everything worked out. Daisel was a natural on camera and his best friend and cousin also became characters in the film. 
 
This project allowed me to dive deeper into my own thoughts, and discover what I am passionate about. Once I found it, all other problems I previously had went away and I looked at life with such excitement and optimism. I hope those who watch this film feel that same sense of empowerment to explore new passions. 
 
Cory Martin y yo decidimos ir a Cuba por un capricho. Acabábamos de terminar otro proyecto de Beautiful Destinations, y nunca habíamos estado en Cuba. Sugerí pasar el fin de semana allí antes de regresar a la oficina en Nueva York el lunes. Él aceptó de manera espontánea, y tomamos la decisión consciente de traer solo un lente cada uno, para poder andar por las calles de La Habana sin un plan establecido.
 
En nuestro primer día en La Habana, escuchamos a Daisel escuchar música hip hop justo afuera de un gimnasio de boxeo. Como me encanta bailar, me acerqué a él y empecé a bailar con él. Desde el principio, pudimos comunicarnos a través del baile y sentí una conexión más profunda con él. Tan pronto como dejamos de bailar, sacó al azar una baraja de cartas y comenzó a realizar trucos de magia. Para nuestra sorpresa, él también era un mago extremadamente talentoso.
 
Después de hablar con Daisel durante treinta minutos y hacerle preguntas sobre su viaje con magia, le dije a Cory: ""Deberíamos volver y contar su historia"".
 
Tres meses después, ambos pudimos encontrar una semana dentro de nuestros horarios de viaje para regresar a Cuba e intentar dar vida a la historia de Daisel.
 
Debido a la falta de Internet en Cuba, no estábamos seguros si Daisel podría encontrarnos y si le apasionaría la visión que tenía en mente para la película. Estaba tan sorprendido de cómo funcionó todo. Daisel era natural en la cámara y su mejor amigo y primo también se convirtieron en personajes de la película.
 
Este proyecto me permitió profundizar en mis propios pensamientos y descubrir lo que me apasiona. Una vez que lo encontré, todos los demás problemas que había tenido anteriormente desaparecieron y miré la vida con tanta emoción y optimismo. Espero que quienes vean esta película sientan la misma sensación de poder para explorar nuevas pasiones.

87,hTTGGOtLunc,Beautiful Destinations,LET’S GO-DUBAI | Beautiful Destinations,"Let’s Go to where culture meets adventure - the architecture will fascinate you and the experiences you have will thrill you. While Dubai may be known for its lavish shopping and grandeur malls, there is so much more to explore in this desert haven. This is an atmosphere unlike anywhere you’ve ever seen, and to experience this desert wonderland in its fullest light, check out our itinerary below for Dubai’s hidden gems.

Friday:
Start your weekend by really getting to know Dubai and the things that make it so extraordinary. Venture to Ripe Market in the early morning to witness the surreal community of local talent and businesses that come together to produce this one-of-a-kind market. Here you can find artisans, designers, and cuisine galore. To continue your adventure that is Dubai, make your way to Jumeirah Beach and visit Surf House Dubai. Surf House’s unconventional and hip environment will fulfill all of your surfing and paddle boarding needs. Afterward, use their facilities to shower off and unwind in their relaxing cafe with fresh, healthy lunch plates. They even often have yoga classes held upstairs, and if you’re looking for a thoughtful and meditative afternoon, make sure to schedule time for a class. Your perfect Dubai evening will start at a cooking class where you will experience the local cuisine hands-on. Learn native Emirati and Middle Eastern recipes from a chef who collected recipes from mothers and grandmothers in the local community. Discover authentic ingredients such as 'loomi,' 'bezar' and 'malleh.'

Saturday:

Take a hot air balloon ride over the endless sand dunes for an adventure you’ll never forget. Be an early riser and venture off into the desert to experience the feeling of peacefully floating into the Arabian sky. Before your eyes, the horizon will blend into beautiful hues of yellows and oranges, painting the ideal Dubai sunrise from 4,000 feet high. Head back to the city for an afternoon of exploring the area of Old Dubai. Being your journey in Al Fahidi, a historical neighborhood known for its traditional buildings and preserved surroundings. For the history buff, make sure to visit Al Fahidi Fort, the home to Dubai Museum’s pearl-diving exhibits, as well as Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum House, a former royal residence showcasing the stories of past residents through photos and documents. To truly witness the hustle and bustle that is a Dubai evening, head over to City Walk for a vast array of shopping, fine dining, and entertainment. Enjoy The Green Planet, the region’s first bio-dome that recreates the enchanting world of a tropical forest with its rich biodiversity of over 3,000 plants and animals. After you’ve worked up an appetite from your trek in the rainforest, enjoy a wonderful meal at one of the nearby restaurants and have yourself a dining experience like no other.

Sunday:
Start your Sunday with a day trip to the beautiful city of Hatta. A 90-minute drive from Dubai, set out right at sunrise to maximize time in this town. Begin your ascent for a morning hiking on the trails near Hatta’s Water Dam, where you will experience sunrise with the backdrop of beautiful mountains and glistening turquoise waters. You will feel like you are on Mars with these views, and it’s the perfect getaway for nature-lovers. On the way down, make time to rent a kayak and explore this view a completely different way. This outdoor adventure is like no other, and the blue waters rival any other like it.

After you’ve soaked up the beauty of Hatta, make your way back to Dubai for an evening safari on the desert. Indulge in dune bashing to the backdrop of pink and golden skies, and enjoy dinner gazing at the stars of a true Arabian night.

88,_OR5PyhqKsA,Beautiful Destinations,LET’S GO – SOUTH DAKOTA | Beautiful Destinations,"Visit The USA (@VisitTheUSA) and a group of top travel creators and influencers from around the world — Alyssa Lynch (@AlyssaLynch), Lauren Bullen (@Gypsea_Lust), Jack Morris (@DoYouTravel), Jordan Hammond (@JordHammond), Jacob Riglin (@Jacob), Max Muench (@MuenchMax), Hayley Vincent (@Hayley_), and Sophia Pope (@SophiaPope) launched the #UnitedStories campaign from the geographical center of the country: Belle Fourche, South Dakota. 
While South Dakota may be known as The Mount Rushmore State, there’s so much more to explore in this Midwestern jewel than rock faces and prairie lands. Steeped in Native American history and fresh with the footprints of legendary pioneers, it offers something for history buffs, adventure-seekers, and culture vultures, alike. Draw inspiration from the great American road trip, rent a classic car, check out the itinerary below, and follow the open road for this untamed state’s hidden gems. 

Friday
The best way to take in this part of the country is from behind the wheel of a classic American car. Set off on an hour drive down I-90 to your first stop: Deadwood, the epitome of the wild, wild west. This historic gold-mining town nestled in the Black Hills offers everything from horse sanctuaries to hiking, mining museums to iconic casinos, so take your pick for a packed day. After a long day in the gold gulch, the road is calling once again. Head south on US-385 through the dense green of Black Hills National Forest, towards President Calvin Coolidge’s “Summer White House” — the State Game Lodge in Custer. 

Saturday 
Start your day at sunrise with Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln — only a 40-minute drive from Custer. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum’s stone masterpiece — the majestic Mount Rushmore National Memorial — has become a beloved symbol of America, and seeing the early golden light sweep across the founding fathers’ faces is enough to make anyone a morning person. When your jaws have sufficiently dropped, let the good times roll in Badlands National Park. 1.5 hours east of Rushmore, the rugged beauty of the national park inspires adventure, and her maze of buttes, spires, and pinnacles provide a striking backdrop to a hike or scenic drive. By now it’s mid-afternoon, and there’s only one place to quench your thirst, satiate your curiosity, and have lunch — Wall Drug. The quirky little roadside attraction is situated just outside Badland’s northern gateway. The pharmacy-come-rest stop earned much of its fame from a self-promotion scheme started by original owners Dorothy and Ted Hustead. Billboards advertising the establishment and “FREE ICE WATER” to thirsty travelers can be seen throughout South Dakota, its neighboring states, and as far as Morocco, Amsterdam, and London, informing commuters that Wall Drug is only a few thousand kilometers away. 

Sunday 
Spend your final morning in Custer at one with nature and gear up for a game drive in the park. Keep your eyes peeled for celebrity state critters — pronghorns, elk, and buffalo. Before heading back to Rapid City, let your last stop be as awe-inspiring as it is important. Half an hour from the State Game Lodge in the heart of the beautiful Black Hills stands another stone masterpiece in the making — Crazy Horse Memorial. In 1948, Polish-American mountain carver Korczak Ziolkowski began sculpting the colossal tribute. Since his passing in 1982, multiple generations of his family have taken over, wielding the chisel and etching the family’s legacy. In its evolving glory — including a museum, a cultural center, and The Indian University of North America — it preserves the heritage of Native Americans and celebrates the heroic acts of Tasunke “Crazy Horse” Witco of the Oglala Lakota tribe. If completed as planned, it will be the world’s second tallest sculpture at a whopping 563 feet high and depict the war leader riding a horse and pointing into the distance.

89,KRaTy54hk-0,Beautiful Destinations,TRUE HAWAII | By Sam Potter and Nainoa Langer | Beautiful Destinations,"The true beauty behind Hawaii’s white sandy beaches and its green bright mountains.

DIRECTOR’S NOTES
Hello, Sam Potter here, I’ve wanted to tell the story of home since I’ve picked up a camera. This may only be a sliver of what we have to share with the world, but I’m proud of what we’ve captured. This all started with a conversation between Nai (Nainoa Langer) and I as we sat above a waterfall overlooking my childhood swimming hole. I said, “We should start a travel-based series that gives people an in-depth look at cultures around the world,” in hopes that we could create something that encourages greater appreciation, understanding, and respect between cultures. His response was “Let’s start with home.” So, we reached out to Beautiful Destinations with the idea, and boom, here we are, (and what I mean by boom is months of hard work and the many, many hurdles that come with planning and executing a film project, hahaha) but nevertheless, here we are. 
My first thought when it came to explaining a place as complex as Hawaii was people need to understand that there are two parts to the culture, the traditional side, and the modern day side. Our modern-day life represented by Kimi Werner, demonstrates our values, the way we care for each other, for our community, and for our environment. The traditional side represented by Micah Kamohoalii, shares a little about the history of Hawaii, the practices of the Hawaiian people, and most importantly, Aloha, what it means and how that too can be practiced. 
Nai and I are very excited to be working with Beautiful Destinations to bring you stories like this from around the world. Our goal is to travel with respect, humility, and curiosity so that we may gain new perspectives, and hopefully we may all become a little more understanding and loving towards one another. 
If you’d like to follow Nai and I as we travel around the world, you can subscribe to Beautiful Destinations’ YouTube channel and follow us on Instagram.

90,eTlZLNws6zc,Beautiful Destinations,VERMONT | Beautiful Destinations,"Visit The USA (@VisitTheUSA) and hall of fame skier, John Egan, show us ski Thrills and zen in the Mad River Valley of Vermont.

DIRECTOR’S NOTES
When Beautiful Destinations notified me that I was heading to Vermont – I was incredibly excited because the Green Mountain State is one of my favorite places. Although I grew up in Israel, I’ve been visiting Vermont since my childhood. After moving to the USA, Vermont, and in particular, the Mad River Valley has become one of my favorite places. It has served as a backdrop for several of my creative projects; from music videos to documentaries and my first feature film.

ON SKIING IN THE MAD RIVER VALLEY OF VERMONT
The Mad River Valley of Vermont is known for its stunning natural beauty and has many hidden gems. The residents are only too happy to share their favorite ski run or swimming hole with visitors. Many people are acquainted with Stowe and Killington, but I wanted to showcase this region, home to small communal towns like Waitsfield and Warren. Surrounded by mountains and ridges rivaling the beauty of the Swiss alps, I knew we had to tell the story of this community through the eyes of someone who encapsulates everything that makes this place so special. 

ON HALL OF FAMER JOHN EGAN
John Egan, member of the Skiing Hall of Fame, star of 17(!) Warren Miller films, and adrenaline junkie, is also the Chief Recreation Officer in the ski resort of Sugarbush, Vermont. After nearly five decades of skiing, often in the most remote locations in the world, such as Siberia and Antarctica, John still loves jumping on the lift line at Sugarbush and skiing with the locals. 

The prospect of filming John Egan was rather intimidating. He is no stranger to cameras, but we wanted to capture John like never before, to highlight his duality. On the one hand, he’s a thrill-seeking skier who constantly pushes himself and his students to the next level. On the other hand, John embodies and preaches the necessity of moving and living in a Zen state. His mantra: Feel the turn evokes the importance of internal peace and a connection to your surroundings and community that one must have in order to continue reaching that next level.

ON OUR CREW AND EQUIPMENT
Our crew skied and snowboarded down the beautiful mountain, doing our best to keep up with John. It was indeed a challenge. One of the greatest things about filming with Beautiful Destinations crews is the mobility and fast pace we can move. Once we begin rolling, we make decisions based on pure creative instinct. In my personal opinion, this is one of the key elements to success, as it provides a platform for creators to constantly explore and to innovate. This project was shot entirely on the Canon 1DX MKII camera. We also used the Ronin-S handheld stabilizer for the skiing shots. The video was edited in Adobe Premiere and colored in DaVinci Resolve.

91,D0Uy3KNxkAA,Beautiful Destinations,PEOPLE OF BHUTAN | Beautiful Destinations,"Join the Beautiful Destinations team as we explore beyond the borders of this ancient kingdom and explore the unique worlds of its incredible people. From a trailblazing female archer to a conservationist who has planted over 100,000 trees, and from artisan papermakers sustaining 300-year-old traditions to dancers who move with the songs of centuries past, these are the stories of the people of Bhutan. 

ON SONAM DEKI, BHUTAN’S TRAILBLAZING FEMALE ARCHER
In Bhutan, archery has become more than just the national sport — it has also become a platform for discussions on gender equality. As a female on the national archery team, Sonam Deki is challenging some of the country’s outdated customs and paving the road for women in the previously male-exclusive competition.

Deki and her team train eight hours a day, sometimes shooting as many as 300 arrows in a single practice. During competitions, they shoot at targets sitting 145 meters away (on the Olympic level, targets lie at half the distance). Deki has already made incredible strides since joining the team in 2014, but her biggest dreams — joining the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and becoming a coach — still lie ahead. 

ON THE “MASKED DANCE OF THE DRUMS”
Drametse Ngacham, “the masked dance of the drums,” was once believed to have been performed by heroes of the celestial worlds. The vibrant masks of the dancers feature intricate details and elements inspired by animals — both real and mythical. The dance, a tradition passed down through five centuries, is considered an art form and is performed, to attract blessings, twice a year at the Drametse Ngacham festival — though it's also used on special occasions for good luck. It's thought to be a mechanism for spiritual empowerment and something the Bhutanese believe everyone should see at least once in a lifetime. 
       
ON ATA SONAM AND A LIFE DEDICATED TO TREES
Atam Sonam’s dedication to the forests started from an early age. Though now retired, Sonam still devotes significant time to protecting and caring for Bhutan's trees. Over the last 35 years, he has planted more than 100,000 trees in and around the Thimphu Valley to combat the effects of climate change — last year alone, he planted more than 300! He is a shining light in the country’s initiative to keep at least sixty percent of its land forested at all times — an effort that has contributed to the country’s status as the only carbon-negative nation in the world.

ON PRESERVING ANCIENT PAPER-MAKING
While used countrywide today, historically, this extensive practice was only used to create scriptures and prayer books for monks. The paper is crafted from Daphne — a plant only found in the Himalayan region — and harvested sustainably to ensure regrowth. Over 300 people are involved in cooking, cleaning, and processing the plant to paper. The seven-day operation is truly an art form; its artisans train for 10 years to master the craft. And while using practices from the 17th century may not be the most practical route, this craft demonstrates the country’s steadfast dedication to preserving its heritage and — with its chemical-free process — also helps to protect the environment.

ON THE CULTURE OF BELIEF
Bhutan is a country of ancient tradition, of scared earth, of unfaltering belief. And while the majority of the population, almost three-quarters, practices the country’s official religion, Vajrayana Buddhism, its spiritual beliefs extend far beyond that — honored in traditions passed down through generations.

One such custom transpires along the winding curves of the Chele La Pass, 2088 meters above sea level. Patrons arrive to burn incense in offering and murmur prayers as they tie flags to poles that jut high above the dusty earth. This custom is performed to bring luck, prosperity, and peace to a family, its community, and all living beings in the world.

92,gEsHsMu7Tfg,Beautiful Destinations,BHUTAN | Beautiful Destinations,"There’s a place on earth, perhaps one of the last, where nature and humans exist as one; the government prioritizes happiness, and conservation of the land and wildlife is so important, laws are in place to protect it. Welcome to Bhutan, the last great “Shangri-La,” the last great oasis.
 
Entering into the grounds of Bhutan is like traversing into a dream. Time seems to slow. The wind breathes through the Himalayas, through the torn prayer-flags lining the high passes, and out through the breaths of chanting monks. Tigers creep through the backcountry, black-necked cranes glide above; the slow crawl of traffic weaves through one designated lane. Everything lives in one harmonious existence. This is a nation with people who welcome you like family. And for those fortunate enough to visit, it will feel like coming home. 
 
ON THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN
Landlocked by China, Tibet, and India, the Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan finds its home nestled on the eastern edge of the Himalayas. The country is known for its dramatic and varying landscapes — vast forests, sweeping valleys, and snowy mountains — which span an area of almost 40,000 square kilometers. Ancient dzongs (fortresses) and ornamental monasteries, including that of the cliff-hanging Tiger’s Nest, are also stunning and well-known fixtures of the country. Culture, sustainability, and deeply-rooted consciousness are prominent values that cling to every aspect of the country and day-to-day life here.
 
ON THE COUNTRY'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
Bhutan's devotion to the environment lies at the root of everything. In 2008, the country created a constitution establishing that a minimum of sixty percent of the country’s land must always be covered by forests. Currently, more than seventy percent of the area is forested. Protection efforts extend to the land’s inhabitants as well; laws are in place making it illegal to hunt or trap wildlife. Thanks to these protections, red pandas, tigers, and almost 800 species of birds can thrive in Bhutan's rich biodiversity. As a result of these conservation endeavors, Bhutan is the only carbon-negative country in the world, meaning that it absorbs more carbon than it produces — four times more, in fact.
 
ON BEING THE HAPPIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
Bhutan is considered the “happiest country” in the world, based off an economic principle known as “Gross National Happiness” (GNH). The term was first coined in 1972 by the fourth king of Bhutan who wanted to ensure that the Bhutanese quality of life was given the same importance as the country's increasing development and growing economy.

 So how do you measure happiness? The government surveys nine domains — categories that encompass wellbeing, culture, environment, education, and good governance — every few years and a single number, derived from further sub-indexes and indicators, is calculated based on the results. One incredible outcome of GNH is it shows that true, sustaining happiness is created by a sense of purpose. And while this index may only seem like data, it represents a set of values that guide citizens in their daily lives and the government in its policies. Other governing entities, like the U.N., have even begun to look to Bhutan to adapt some of its practices.
 
ON SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL (TO AND WITHIN THE COUNTRY)
Visitors are required to apply for a visa and book their travel through a tourism agency sponsored by the government. There is a $200 minimum visa fee per day which covers all costs including meals, accommodations, transport within the country, and a licensed Bhutanese tour guide.While some travelers may not be fond of being with a guide at all times, many find they prefer it. These highly equipped guides can set up excursions based on specific interests — hiking, food, culture, conservation, art — allowing visitors to craft more meaningful itineraries and create friendships and cultural exchanges with locals that may not have occurred otherwise. Think of these guides as guardian angels of the country and its guests.

At Beautiful Destinations, we're always striving to create something unique and original. For us, ""Euro Trippin'"" represents an area of the world that has been shot a million times, but what excited us about this project was coming up with something truly different. 

We gave ourselves 30 days to get to as many countries as possible in Europe. The goal was to visit the most iconic locations in each destination and capture a perspective that hadn't been seen before. We knew we'd need to be agile and spontaneous, so we challenged ourselves to execute this with a small team. Tom Jauncey led the charge visiting all 20 countries in 30 days, Matias De Rada supported by visiting 12 countries, Sage Stephens joined for six countries, Jake Irish for five, and Kay Van Huisseling for one country. To make things a little more exciting, we challenged ourselves to travel with only carry-on luggage — one bag each for only our equipment!

As we deep-dived into the planning for this video, we identified a fun common thread that would showcase each location's culture as well as its iconic modes of transportation — from the gondolas in Venice and the bicycles in Amsterdam to river surfing in Munich. Our story of traveling around Europe came to life through the thread of transportation. 

Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Beautiful Destinations, and to further this originality we made the creative decision to shoot this project predominantly on the GoPro Fusion (a 360-degree camera). The London introduction sequence is the only footage shot on a traditional DSLR camera (the Canon 1DX Mark II). Except for the aerial shots, everything else was shot in 360. Instead of creating a 360 VR experience, we wanted to take a new technology, push it to its limits, and come up with something unique and exciting. Editing this content is what truly differentiated the video and what gives it that trippy feeling. The project was completed solely in Adobe After Effects, a workflow that was very different than what we are used to doing.

Our vision for this video was to be a positive and fun celebration of traveling around Europe. We wanted to pay homage to British pop culture, referencing inspiration from Colin Firth in ""The King's Speech,"" The Daily Prophet in the ""Harry Potter"" films, as well as Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch.""

As Beautiful Destinations pushes into the world of purpose-driven storytelling, we wanted to create something fun that would engage our community while also touching on an important cause — empowering young people to get out and have their voices heard. While on the trip, we stopped in Brussels to meet with the European Parliament to speak about programs that encourage today’s youth to express themselves, stand up for what they believe, and make an impact. During the visit, we learned about the declining numbers of youth participation in important global elections, and it was this that inspired us to help make a difference and encourage the next generation to vote. By making something fun and relatable, we hope we can spread the positive message of getting out there and expressing yourself. 

Thank you very much to all the amazing people that helped us throughout this adventure:

94,5CbRcgWfJlo,Beautiful Destinations,"OCEAN CONSERVATION: Hilo, Hawaii","Visit The USA (@VisitTheUSA) and surfer and scientist, Cliff Kapono, share the beauty of Hawaii's beaches and the importance of taking care of the ocean.

In a world where real-life paradises are under threat from pollution, pro-surfer-turned-scientist Dr. Cliff Kapono uses his first-hand knowledge of, passion for, and dedication to the environment to help save the iconic and picturesque beaches of Hawaii. 

Venture alongside Cliff as he pulls us into his life in Hilo — a place where the realms of science, nature, and discovery intersect. Alongside his field work, number crunching, and surfing, he is passionate about reflecting on our responsibility as children of this earth, leaving us with the question, ""Am I going to keep changing nature because of my behavior, or am I going to start changing my behavior around nature?""

On Hilo

Hilo, Hawaii is located on the eastern coast of the “Big Island.” Officially known as the Island of Hawaii, Big Island received its nickname to help distinguish itself from the 1,500-mile long — and perhaps more well known — archipelago with which it shares name.

At an estimated 800,000 years old, Hilo is the oldest city in the Hawaiian Archipelago and is ripe with dramatic waterfalls, fertile rainforests, and lush gardens, and has a downtown area that overlooks Hilo Bay and rests on two dormant volcanoes — Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea. The city is also home to the world’s largest processor of macadamia seeds — the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation — the University of Hawaii, the Imiloa Astronomy Center, and the Merrie Monarch Festival, which is a seven-day festival celebrating the ancient and modern art of hula.

On Cliff and His Work

As a native Hawaiian, Cliff Kapono does his part when it comes to understanding and respecting his environment. His background is in molecular bioscience, and he's produced a handful of award-winning films that delve into indigenous activism, ocean conservation, global food security, and virtual reality. 

To understand his connection with Hawaii, he refers to his roots in surfing, the ocean, and his environment: “The more I started to think about how we describe the relationship between humans and their environment, science became this really natural way of expressing that — the idea of biology, the idea of chemicals, and the exchanges between different organisms through root systems.” He prides himself on understanding the systems he depends on for surfing, as well as being knowledgeable about how he can do his part to help the environment. 

On Plastic 

When envisioning paradise, soaking up the sun on one of Hawaii's pristine beaches may very well be the first scene that comes to mind — not the plastic pollution shown in the video. However, with over 8 million tons of plastic ending up in our oceans each year, rising pollution rates are endangering ocean life and washing up on shore — and Kamilo Beach, located on the southeastern coast of Big Island in Hawaii, is not immune to this threat. 

With the help of individuals like Cliff Kapono and organizations like Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii — a local nonprofit with a mission to inspire the community to care for the coastline through beach cleanups — groups have come together to recycle over 200,000 pounds of ocean plastic, helping protect the beauty and health of the planet. 

By raising awareness of plastic pollution and helping rid our environment of it, we can all be part of a larger movement toward preserving the world's paradises.

On Doing Your Part 

Doing your part to help the environment begins with educating yourself and others. With endless volunteer opportunities available at any time, there's no better time than the present to find a local organization near you. Join a beach cleanup, plant trees in your city, or donate to an animal conservation program — the sky's the limit. By learning more about the efforts happening near (or far) from you, you're well on your way to giving back to a world that provides you so much — just like Cliff.

98,pwVVJyEHY6w,Beautiful Destinations,"Mumbai, India - Giving Back","Last month, Beautiful Destinations and Air Canada teamed up in Mumbai, India to act on a shared passion for diversity, inclusivity, and equality by unveiling a project months in the making — a fully-refurbished, mural-filled basketball court in the heart of the city.

Developed especially for the local community, we partnered with the ST+ART India Foundation and Mumbai artist Sajid Wajid Shaikh to create a court that not only encourages sport but one that also inspires creativity. The court provides a positive space for people of all ages, races, and genders to join together in one exciting and inclusive game, as well as creates a lasting artistic legacy that can be seen from the sky.

After the big reveal, we hosted a community basketball clinic for youth in the area while working with the Dribble Academy to discover more ways to use basketball as a platform for channeling positive energy — a big “thank you” to all of the incredible groups and individuals below.

104,jqI7py5QVV0,Beautiful Destinations,Let's Go - Paris,"‘Let’s Go’ to the City of Light and love — to explore the monument-lined boulevards, world-class cuisine, and art-enriched streets of Paris. 

There’s a reason the storied, romantic city of Paris is one of the world’s most visited capitals. Tourists flock to see the classic architecture and the famous paintings in the Louvre, to eat at Michelin-starred restaurants and shop at chic boutiques, and to experience the wonder of religious structures like the intricate, majestic Notre-Dame cathedral — but to keep going back to Paris is only to find out there is always more to see. Each district carries rich and multicultural heritage, from the compact but incredible Cambodian and Laotian restaurants of the 13th arrondissement to the shtiebels of the Marais’ Jewish quarter to the long, cobbled halls populated with historical figures of the Père Lachaise cemetery in the 20th arrondissement. 

Buy a baguette for under a euro and some classic Parisian butter, and wander the banks of the Seine, stopping every so often to peruse the wares of the bouquinistes, small vintage book-sellers that line the ‘only river in the world that runs between two bookshelves.' Sit on the steps in front of the white-domed Sacré-Cœur and watch as performers juggle footballs while climbing the lampposts, all with the entire cityscape spread out behind them. Walk down to explore the rest of Montmartre — stop in at once of the classic Parisian cafes for the plat du jour and a noisette, an espresso with a hazelnut-sized dollop of cream. You could go to Pigalle to experience the traditional “Paris by night,” or hit the best punk bar in town, hidden in the backstreets and alleys of the Bastille. 

Or, visit any of the other incredible places captured by the BD team: Les Deux Plateaux, the Montparnasse Tower, the Jardin Du Palais, Belleville, Saint-Germain-Des-Prés, Metiers Metro Station and the Trocadero. Whatever you do, wear your rose-tinted glasses and comfortable shoes.

106,MuETQnBQ58E,Beautiful Destinations,The Power Within — Storm Chasing with Ty Schmitt,"Take a ride through tornado alley as former NFL player Ty Schmitt and the Beautiful Destinations team chase powerful storms across the Great Plains of the United States.

Storm chasing refers to the pursuit of any severe weather, with the first documented chases starting as far back as in 1938. Though quite dangerous, many people still choose to carry on the legacy, going to great lengths to photograph raging storms that often have the strength to destroy everything in their paths.

Ty has the chase down to a science and has harnessed the power of the storms he documents to help himself overcome personal demons. In this episode, he courageously talks about his struggle to find his identity after a career-ending injury in the NFL and a battle with drug addiction.

Whether it's through chasing storms, photographing landscapes, cooking, writing, playing music, or playing sports, at the end of the day, we’re all seeking meaning and purpose in life — and our passions provide a vehicle to help cut through the chaos and better understand who we really are and who we want to be. While this piece is indeed about the thrill of chasing storms, the deeper message is one of determination, unrelenting passion, and never giving up hope.

Follow along as Ty pursues his passion and pushes the boundaries of storm chasing and landscape photography.

https://www.instagram.com/tyschmitt/

Please note that Ty is a trained professional and that the actions performed in this video should not be attempted without proper guidance and training.

We first visited this charming Southeast Asian country in 2016 and immediately fell in love. Two years later, the destination remains fun and energetic, and we couldn't wait to dive deeper into this island paradise. This time, we visited the mountainous region of the Cordilleras, the vibrant coastal town of Puerto Princesa, and the country’s top surfing island destination, Siargao. Each place has its own unique story to tell, but they are all tied together by one common thread — the genuine kindness of the Filipino people that makes everything more fun in the Philippines.

139,reqW1NKgXMk,Benn TK,I left home to live in Bali - But was it everything I dreamed?,"Being a content creator can sometimes mean choosing a path that splits you're relatability away from the norm. Making you feel isolated. After learning the city I lived was far and few of others in the creative world, I decided to leave in search of a place where there were many others on a similar path where I could grow further and relate. Bali was known for being a content creator paradise, so I heard. I decided to live in Bali for 4 months to see if it was everything I hoped, If so I would consider staying. Unfortunately even tho it was mostly what I had dreamed, and I felt were I belonged, my journey was cut short by a terrible accident.

https://www.instagram.com/benn_tk/

Benn’s past 2 years had a significant toll on him as he discovered the reality of hair loss a growing anxiety and mental battles like he had never experienced before. He attempt to get his hair back by using Regaine Minoxidil, and finasteride but the results are yet to come. Benn finds a love in the centre of the pandemic and finally understands what it’s like to have a partner by his side, however this bliss was only temporary. His youtube channel also takes a big hit during the covid 19 pandemic as not being able to make cinematic travel videos during this time has impacted his viewership for later videos. However, he has hit a silver lining and realized that he wasn’t enjoying the videos he had been making which enforced a change. Benn also discovers he has spent far too much time in Melbourne city where there are too few creators to teach him the new skills he needs to grow in his creative industry. He was also quite lonely as his freedom to take a week day off to explore meant almost none of his good friends would be free to join him on an adventure. 
Benn realizes he has outgrown the city he once called home and finds himself on a new path to surround himself with more creators like him and travel to a place that is vibrant of creative minds. A place to flourish, learn and grow.
He was also secretly hoping to find the girl he would spend the rest of his life with, and this new change of scenery was likely to bring him that. Along the way Benn continues to film his adventures and create cinematic travel videos to show the journey.

DESCRIPTION

We were all wrecked from 3 weeks of intense exploring around the south island of New Zealand, and desperately needed a good sleep in once we arrives at our last stop of the trip, Wanaka.
But there was one last incredible must do hike here, so the team and I decided to brave the exhaustion, and end the trip on one of the most beautiful hikes in the world, and believe me, it was worth the effort.

Never before in my life would I have even thought to do one of these hikes, it just seemed like something that was a bit out there and not 
entirely my vibe, but I guess that's like a lot of things until we actually try them and give them a go, now I'm stunned by how incredible doing something like this can be,
how character building it is and the secret forms of nature you can only find on an adventure like this one. I can't wait to come back to New Zealand and see what other insane
hidden hike gems are out there.

155,GbrRighb4Es,Benn TK,LOST IN DUBAI | Travel short film,"LOST IN DUBAI

Back in November 2021 I was invited to Dubai to create a new video for my channel. However I saw this as an opportunity to create something completely different to anything I had ever done before. A short film style travel video.
Something I had been wanting to make for so long but never had he right opportunity until this trip. It definitely tested everything I knew and pushed myself and the team to the limits to capture and prepare everything we needed. 
With traditional B roll travel videos usually you plan a little and then shoot what ever happens and put it together later when you get home but the nature of this film was much different. If anything fell out of place 
or didn't work out for the story on the day we would have had to cancel the concept and go with a plan B. With so many variables and unforeseen events that could go wrong and stop this film from coming to life eg. actors pulling out, chasing day light to name a few, It was an incredibly challenging experience to keep the end goal staying a float.
But as a team we worked very hard together to make sure this vision could come to life, as difficult and challenging as it was, It ended up being the most rewarding thing I've ever made.

Go pro footage has never really hit the mark for me and flying a lot of 5 inch FPV's lately made me wish I could put my Sony on one. Then iflight released The Taurus x8, In this video I attempt to capture stunning aerial footage on the cine lifter FPV.

Even though my results in the end turned out okay I'm even more determined now to try a different camera as I have seen people get some amazing results with a black magic pocket 4k / 6k

It's been almost 2 years since I began flying FPV drones and I've learnt so much during that time. It's a big learning curve to conquer when getting into this type of drone flying but such an incredible immersive experience once you get the hang of it. This video will help you figure out what is the best FPV for you and give you a huge insight to the Nazgul from iflight and how their FPV drones work.

This was probably one of the most fun videos I've ever made,. There is just something about filming in first person view that feels authentic and more engaging. 

There were many new challenges that I had to overcome to film some of these one shot take scenes with special effects, so it was a tough video to produce but that made it so rewarding to get the outcome I desired.

The information in this video has been delivered from the best of my abilities.

Okay so this is the fastest computer I've used, and exports videos 3 times quicker than my older desktop setup. MSI have crushed it with this one. This desktop set up is now my new setup for editing and I'll be using it to create my future videos.

It's worth a mention that it used to be a struggle for me to work with 360 camera footage, but this new computer has allowed me to play back Insta 360 video codecs ( no proxy ) in 1/8 resolution very rarely dropping frames.

A journey that was full of laughs and friendly faces. Finally after 2 and a bit years I found the time to put together this edit of our adventure while being locked down here in Melbourne, Australia. It was a nostalgic thing to look back on these memories from the past and made me truly appreciate them more, now that I am stuck here at home. It was a challenge making this video match the standards of my videos as the footage was old and drone shot, shot with a Mavic 1, but I'm happy with the outcome!

168,GBPY1Ffaf3Q,Benn TK,Cebu - Whale sharks and waterfalls. The Philippines Journey - Vlog Ep 2,"Cebu - The Philippines Journey - Vlog Ep 2

December of 2018, some friends and I decided to explore the Philippines.
Little did we know it would be one of the greatest adventures of our lives.
In the first Episode we explored some parts of Palawan, visiting Puerto Princesa, Port Barton and El Nido. In this episode we explore the island of Cebu, Venturing to Moalboal where the famous Kawasan falls lives and then to Oslob, home of the gentle giants, the whale sharks!
These Vlogs are not by any means meant to be epic and 1 up my other videos, but simple visual memories i now get to keep on the internet for years to come and to look back on. 

I hope you enjoy (:

Episode 3 is in the making and it will be the final episode of this series.

Erik, Vunkki and I arrived just in time to experience the colourful celebrations of holi, where coloured starch powder is thrown, with water throwing and many other prank like activities that take place on every street. We had the experience of a lifetime getting involved in the celebrations and being covered in colours. Unfortunately due to the restrictions of the COVID19 virus covering the globe, we had to leave India early to go back to our homes. We planned to visit many more places North and South, however we could only stay for 10 days, and in that time we visited Delhi, Vrindivan, Mathura, Orcha, Agra, and Varanasi. However even though we didn't see all of India's amazing locations, it gives us a great reason to come back again!

Ft JR Alli | Cinematic video,"JR and I had been wanting to meet up and shoot together for quite some time, and we decided Hong Kong City would be the perfect place to create some awesome videos! As the date got closer to leave for Hong Kong, we became anxious and cautious about the protesting that seemed to be getting worse. But took the plunge and decided to still go and pursue our journey. We had no trouble once we were there and fell in love with the Dense concrete jungle like buildings and were amazing to find so much nature surrounding Hong Kong. This was our journey to the beautiful Hong Kong City and what went down, we hope you enjoy 🙂

176,07lHXqVb-bA,Benn TK,Palawan - Port Barton and El Nido. The Philippines Journey - Vlog Ep 1,"Philippines Journey - Palawan

Most of you have probably seen my cinematic film ( Philippines - Land of Enchanted Islands ) but until now no one has seen what adventures went down while filming that video in the Philippines.
This Is the place where it all started, Palawan. Palawan was an obvious choice to visit as it has so many beautiful locations within the Island. My goal was to film as much as possible to have enough footage at the end to create a Beautiful cinematic video, and of course have a great time doing so. I made my way from Puerto Princesa, visiting the insane Cave system there, and then to Port Barton, where i made a bunch of new friends and was truely getting the Philippines vibe. The after 3 days in Port Barton I left my new friends to get on a 4 hour van to El Nido where i would meet my buddy Mark Mitchel. from then on El Nido became a dream as we met with others, and set off on boat tours around this beautiful paradise.

Being Strangers at first, we explored some of the most beautiful, and rugged places the island had to offer, sharing memories and special moments that you couldn't repeat if you tried. While experiencing the greats, we also experienced the lows, but turned things around to make the tough times some of the best memories we have of this land, and before we realised, these moments took us from strangers, to best friends.

This place is now one of my all time favourite places to be, not just because of the incredible waterholes and pure island nature, but also because while we were exploring these beautiful, tropical Islands the locals made us feel so welcome and were incredibly friendly. We had some crazy adventures here starting from Porto Princessa in Palawan then travelling 4 hours by van up to Port Barton, then 4 hours again by van to El Nido where we saw some of the craziest sunsets of our lives and went out on many boat tours meeting loads of other adventurous travellers and sharing our stories together. We then travelled to Cebu to experience the beautiful waterfalls and lush tropical forests. Then to Bohol, an awesome little island full of life and vibrant creatures, and the chocolate hills! Then off to Siargao one of my favourite islands of all time where we made some amazing local friends that we had some great adventures with and even today we still talk! The weather throughout our journey was not the best so we had to make do with the good days we did have. unfortunately we never made it to Coron island, but that's one for next time!
I'll always have a special spot in my heart for south east asia, you just can't compare it to anywhere else!

Some Facts about the video and editing!

Altogther this video took almost 3 months of solid editing to create! Orgionaly filmed in december 0f 2018, I was unable to start working on it straight away due to lots of client work and other oppertunities that took my time away from this project. This project was vertually an unplanned edit except for the intro sequence where i pre planned to film a scene of myself diving into the sand on a nice beach to create the portal effect later on with that intro. Everything else was rush planned on the actual trip. This project was edited in Premiere pro and after Effects and has over 91 after effects compositions. It also contains 466 separate sounds. I cant even explain how many times premiere pro or after effects crashed making this video, so much to the point where i'm considering using another platform, not to mention the glitches, but after fixing all this i was very happy with the result!

Thailand will always have a special place in my heart. it was here that i learnt travelling wan't just about seeing new destinations, but it was also about the people you venture into them with, that happiness comes from the smiles around us not the amount of items we possess. i grew so much here in a short amount of time, and i can't wait to be back. My journey started in Phuket where i met some other travellers at a hostel. We became best friends in a matter of days, and travelled to the phi phi islands, Krabi, Koh Tao, Koh pha ngan and many more places. From Bangkok to Chiang Mai from Chiang Rai to Pai, i managed to see almost all of Thailand and met so many unforgettable faces along the way. What a journey it was! i Can't wait to travel to Thailand again! Cup coon cup!

My Journey to travel the world and leave my old life behind had led me to the Beautiful city of Singapore. i decided to explore the two famous domes which held a little world inside. The flower dome, and the cloud dome located next to the marina bay sands. the flower dome is home to many species of flowers, and the cloud dome has its own mountain in the centre with a beautiful man made waterfall. Both domes cost16 SGD to enter or if you do two in a day it will cost $28 all together. It was an incredible experience and something i would highly recommend! It was amazing to travel in Singapore for a few days! Huge videos coming people! so soo excited to show you what is next!

Most people come to Bangkok as a stop over or a day trip, or to experience the crazy night life it has to offer, but after my brother Jamie and i spent more than a week in Bangkok, we discovered that it was so much more than that. Outside of the touristic pathways it was a beautiful home and way of life for many locals, honing their craft, and raising loving families.

198,LrR4GiLqOBg,Benn TK,Cambodia - Siem Reap - Cinematic Vlog 14,"After Thailand, Cambodia was the next destination on my list, I started in Siem Reap, Cambodia's main tourist destination, where most of the famous temples are located. it costs $37 U.S dollars to purchase a day pass to Angkor Wat and other temples. Siem Reap also has some crazy nightlife and a famous street called pub street where you can't have a bad time. I stayed at the Funky flash packers hostel and mad monkey hostels when travelling Siem reap where i met lots of amazing people. Travelling from Thailand to Cambodia is as simple as booking a bus from Bangkok to Siem Reap. New videos on the way! Peace!

200,hXUaPrcjs4Q,Benn TK,Koh Phi Phi Island - Thailand - Cinematic vlog 13,"After meeting 4 solo travelers in Phuket, we decided to join up and travel to the famous Phi Phi island, known for its wild beach parties and amazing scenery.  About a 3 hour fairy ride from Phuket, the island has many things to do and see, such as a bout tour around 
the other islands that surround Ko Phi Phi which costs around 2000 Baht. (80) Australian dollars. I would recommend spending around 3 to 4 days on the island to experience everything. The Story Continues!

210,UQ6Mvpt4QD8,Benn TK,Depression - It's time to change,"Depression claims the lives of many Australians each year, and although we ask thos who are unhappy to speak out and talk about their feelings, many are unable to open up and seek the help they need, and the numbers continue to rise, it's time to work together as brothers and sisters, to not only help those in deep need of emotional solace, but to help prevent it, by becoming better human beings, free of greed, and educated about the other lives around us. it's time to be better, we can be better.
it's time to for a selfless revolution.

this was something very important and personal to me and many of my friends around me, i know it's not a travel video, but what good am i if i don't do anything for the world as well? my friends and i worked for a few months putting this together over time, and i can't thank them enough for their help.

there are many different types of depression, unfortunately this video does not cover all of them, diseases, cancers, conditions and general unhealthiness that weren't necessarily caused by human beings can be a huge contribution to depression But this video is about the type that we have the power to change by being better human beings, peace out! love TK, and keep going!",,2017-06-01T10:12:09Z,58538,3521,343,PT5M18S,hd,false

263,p_itTiQLxlA,Mitchell Mullins,Cinematic FPV Reel 2021 - (Mitchell x Tantago),"After years of flying, crashing, and everything in between I could not be more stoked to be dropping the first FPV Reel. Picking up FPV as a hobby at the end of 2018 I quickly became addicted to the fast pace and flow induced art of drone flying. Incredibly grateful to be surrounded by a community of film loving and creative friends to keep pushing each other to new heights.

One afternoon Keane and I came up with the idea to do a collab reel after joking how crazy of a video we could make if we combined all of our footage over the years.

264,wSC6WsEx8Lw,Mitchell Mullins,Fall Out of Love With It,"The idea for “Fall Out of Love With It” came after a period of creative frustration last year when everything was not clicking. I found myself stressed, overwhelmed, and confused with the process that drives so much of what I do. With all problems in life, we stand back up, learn from our mistakes, and come back stronger. As the pieces fell back into place I dove into this project as a reminder to myself.
- Fall out of love with it. Disappear from it. And come back stronger.

268,dxA3g81QHyw,Mitchell Mullins,Moments: Exploring Mauritius Island [Diving],"""A Moment In Mauritius"" - Earlier this year Mike and I had the opportunity to visit the island of Mauritius. Located 300 miles off the coast of the island of Madagascar. Staying for a week we got dive certified and began exploring under the water as well as across the island. This project “A Moment in Mauritius” was shot in just more than 24hrs as most of our days were rained out. Focused heavy on pushing the modern vintage style in this piece. Pushing myself to try new sound design techniques. Super stoked with this piece and got some absolute bangers in the works.

Feeling incredibly focused lately and surrounding myself with only the best thinkers and creatives.
The clips in this edit are from my travels in 2018. With 300 days consecutively on the road, I'm finally back home in Los Angeles. Feeling like a new start and getting into a routine.
Working through last years footage while planning this year's projects. HA. you all aren't ready. Were absolutely destroying 2019.

Keep pushing for what is yours. Make it happen. Make it your reality. Everyone is thinking and making ideas on how they want it to be. JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN. No one is executing.

Getting to make a trip happen with JR and Lishen was insane! Such a great group of guys to take on the Lofoten islands! This film I wanted to focus on highlighting the landscape and try to show how vast and crazy the landscape actually was. Threw in a voiceover in the middle to share my biggest takeaway and personal growth that happened during the trip! Feeling more and more confident in sharing my ideas through voiceovers as I grow as a storyteller.
The first version of this film can be found on my Instagram IGTV (Linked Below) - Had to change the first two songs due to copyright.

275,r72mn6bqHeE,Mitchell Mullins,Exploring The Pacific North West - [INSPIRE II Zenmuse X7],"This film is about the time Kyle, Arnie, and I got the opportunity from DJI to use the Inspire II (Zenmuse X7)! We decided to take a spontaneous trip up the coast to Kyle’s house in Washington and this was our adventure along the way!
Nothing more than good times with the guys and growing our skills with the Inspire II (A learning curve for sure!)
We filmed this project back in January and finally got around to editing and releasing it in June.. LOL. Lots more films coming at you guys super soon.
Thank you for the unreal amount of support on this channel! You guys are amazing! Always working hard and doing whatever it takes to get us to the next level. Head down working harder than ever.

After eating a Norwegian meal we headed out on a sea raft. Going 90mph across the sea with the ocean pelting your face was an intense but crazy adventure. Another day of epic content. We headed out to see if we couldn't capture the Northern Lights but after hours of hunting we called it off for the night. Check tomorrows vlog.. wink.. wink.. Hope you guys enjoyed todays vlog.

Kyle Houck and Arnie Watkins. In the vlog we stopped by Oregon to meet the local legend Tayler Steven and drove an hour south to Abiqua Falls.
This vlog was day 1/6 of our trip up the coast shooting for DJI with the new Inspire 2 Zenmuse X7 Camera. Super stoked to show you guys the video we have been working on and the crazy crazy shots weve gotten so far.
Going to be doing a series of the 360 vlogs here in the near future. Really excited about this one and it was just a whole new way to share the day.

Wanted to test around with some new concepts with this video making the mood as dark and commercial as possible. Will keep this piece as a staple for commercial work. Got a lot more crazy stuff planned for the future. Super stoked and working hard. One day at a time were doing this thing. Hard work is going to pay off. Just watch.. Lets go man. Stoked.

The title ""WANDERER"" came from us setting out and wandering for hours before sunrise to find a location to shoot. All about the journey and very excited about the way this video turned out!

With each new edit I hope to focus on certain aspects of my filmmaking to grow long term. With this edit my primary goal was to create a seamless, hype, and desert themed edit. Put a lot of work into the transitions and matching the footage to the music. Hope you guys enjoy the edit and let me know what you think. Critiques are always accepted :)

Also, thank you to everyone who helped out with this project. It means the world to me and I could not have done it without you guys.

I had a week full of adventures planned and an urge to fly my new drone. Decided to film the majority of the film in DLOG and graded it in DaVinci Resolve 14. My first impressions of this little guy are off the wall. Very excited to get the Phantom 4 Pro back into the field and start making bigger films.

Filmed entirely on the Phantom 4 Pro at 4k 60fps.
Many of the clips were slowed to 50% and exported at 4k 29.97fps.

Shoutout to everyone who helped make this film happen. For the clips I am in I obviously wasn't flying the drone haha. Thank you Mason Mitchell for your insane drone operating skills! Also, thank you Kyle for throwing the drone up to get the shot!

Check them out! Mason & Kyle

While on our adventure we captured the moment with a Super 8 camera. After shipping off the footage we put together an edit of our adventure. While editing I quickly realized this is one of my favorite videos. The emotions are so raw and the footage is so vintage. Makes you think about why you love to make films in the first place. Crazy what you can see when you stop and listen. This will not be the last Super 8 Film project. Wish you all the best with anything you're working on. Thank you for all the support.

300,5w6lylxV6nY,Mitchell Mullins,IMPERIAL SAND DUNES - MITCHELL MULLINS,"Another edit in the photo mission series. After staying in California with Spencer we decided to make the three hour drive to the Imperial Sand Dunes (Algodones Dunes). We made it just for sunset and ran around the dunes with our cameras. This edit felt very different after the last film I put out ""Too Far Gone"" it felt very simplistic and did not add as much value or tell a story through the video. This past month has caused me to think in a way I never have before and has refined my creative ambitions. I have never been more excited to put out content and evolve with every video. Lots of new things coming in the future. I wish I could thank each and every one of you for the un ending support. It means the world to me. Thank You.

301,yD92E5isTL4,Mitchell Mullins,"""Too Far Gone"" - A Testament To Creatives","“Too Far Gone” is a testament to creatives who often find themselves absent from the moment. Not through choice but from their own drive to create. Its so important to stop and appreciate the moments for what they are and what they stand for.
Eli and I co produced this project incorporating both of our styles into the film. We wanted to uncover the truth behind experiencing and living the moment through a lens. Always staying in the process. Growing, inspiring, and never ceasing to create.

302,S6xc5hAhM2U,Mitchell Mullins,EXPLORING CALIFORNIA [4k] - MITCHELL MULLINS,"EXPLORING CALIFORNIA -  A Mitchell Mullins Film
This film takes place from March 13th to April 13th while living out of a van with my best friend Jackson Thomas traveling across California. We stopped all along the coast meeting up with friends and took thousands of photos and videos. My goal for this travel film was to show our raw adventures and truly capture the beautiful sights we saw along our journey. Spencer Miller is a new best friend we met along the trip and spontaneously decided to take a doorless helicopter ride over Long Beach. Sadly our trip was cut short when Jackson and I were driving just outside of Denver and rolled 6 times across the interstate. We are both extremely humbled to have the chance to fully recover. If I can get anything across with this film it is that you should live everyday as if it was your last. Live for your passion and follow your heart. Many exist, few live.

Thank you all for the constant support. I can not wait for whats next!

308,1cr6n6S_sxM,Mitchell Mullins,EXPLORING BANFF NATIONAL PARK - A7SII (4K),"Exploring Banff National Park - A7SII (4K)
A Travel Film By Mitchell Mullins. 2016.
 Today I’m excited to release my favorite project to date. Exploring Canada (Banff National Park). Bradley Millstone & Myself (Mitchell Mullins) recently took a trip to Canada. We visited Lake Louise, Lake Moraine, Took the Banff Gondola, Explored the Vermillion Lakes, as well as Johnston Canyon & Plain of Six Glacier Trail.
 With this film I really wanted to push myself! I rented the A7SII and filmed 95% of the film in SLOG3. That in itself pushed me to become a better colorist and editor as I obsessed over the A7SII’s 1080p @120fps!! Hopefully this adventure will be the first of many in my Travel Film series. For the time being I’ve got lots of big things coming, lots more vlogs, and a change of scenery (coming soon..). Stay well. Stay Happy. Stay Adventurous.
 
I vlogged every day of the trip! (Follow my journey in the link below!)

349,-eLzVYpbMa8,kold,I made a Creative Film about a Folding phone (OnePlus Open),"Learn more about the OnePlus Open here https://onepl.us/46FEINZ 

When @oneplus asked me to make something for the launch of their newest phone the “open” I decided to use this as an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and make a short film as well as most of the music in it as well. It was a month of experimentation, learning new things, late nights (a good amount of all nighters), successes and failures but through it all reigniting my love for story telling and creating. 

Thank you OnePlus for making this project happen! :) 

Shoutout to @mustiymk for helping me at every step of the way to turn this vision into a finished film, couldn’t have done it without you bro

https://koldercreative.com/enroll

I can’t believe the day has come. After what feels like forever (more like 8 months of working on and off) I’m excited to announce my first ever online course @koldercreative is live.
When I started this I had no idea how much of an undertaking this project would be. But after a lot of revisions and learning, the course is finally at a place to go out to the world and have its first round of students.

This first instalment of the course is focused on the foundations of Premiere Pro, After Effects, Shooting, Technicalities and FPV. A lot of very important information that I wish I had when I was first developing my workflow as a creative. Honestly Even a year ago when I considered myself a “highly skilled” editor, i still would have been able to drastically speed up my workflow and improve my quality with the information i share in this course. I walk you guys through my editing process in both Premiere Pro and After Effects then dive into the world of FPV as well as shooting and business.

This is just the start for me. My vision with this course is to constantly be upgrading my content and updating these lessons with everything I've learned, and everything I am yet to learn throughout my journey as an editor / filmmaker.

also this is not a ad for DJI. although I do work with DJI regularly but they did not pay me to make this video, this is just my honest review of my experience using this new drone for the past month! 
I have several mavic 2's and zooms  but this drone just takes the cake for me. Love everything about it!

From the red seas crystal clear waters and white sand beaches to the rich history permanently etched into the rock formations in AlUla. Saudi Arabia had peaked my wonder and curiosity like a child again. As I walked through the tight cracks in the unending rock clusters of Al’Ula my mind would think back to a time where humans roamed the land without the modern day technological advancements we are all so used to. Our guide jokingly said that the etchings in the wall are like twitter but thousands of years ago. Very true. Humans would use the walls to communicate where to

Find water, tell stories and share art. What a way to live. I was also pleasantly surprised on this trip to be able to see dolphins jump along side our boat as we sailed to  the islands on the Red Sea in Umluj. for some reason I would have never thought dolphins could be found in the Middle East, so this was definitely a surprise for me. And To top it off visiting the city of Riyadh and the surrounding Al Turaif district, seeing the preserved old town where it all started and  seeing first hand the history that shaped this country into what it is today.  This trip was full of surprises to say the least and I’m excited to be able to share with you all some of the memories I’ve captured during my time in Saudi.

""Don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive. Because what the world needs most, is more people who come alive."" - Howard Thurman


6 months ago I began this project, and since then it has consumed every part of my being. The day I would click upload seemed like it was a million miles away. It feels weird knowing that it's over. Never in my life have i put this much of myself into one project, but this one was special and I knew i had to give it my all. Collectively I've put well over 500 hours of focused editing into this video. I spent 3 weeks on a flipped sleep schedule where I would wake up after sunset and work throughout the night in complete isolation and go to sleep as the sun would rise. I made a lot of sacrifices to make this happen. If you guys want to support me and continue seeing more passion driven work please share and make sure to follow me on all my social channels!

This Vlog was super fun to film and couldnt have asked for a better squad to make it possible! we actually came up with the idea for the intro midway through the trip and shot it on our very last night in Jakarta. We didnt know if it would work but it turned out better than expected haha! hope you guys enjoy this one.

They say amateurs find themselves waiting for inspiration to strike, while the pros get up and go to work. Whether it’s in the pre planning stages or post production, I would have to say that music is the single most powerful creative contributor to my work. It always influences the direction my projects take.

With a huge collection of music, Musicbed is a place for my mind to run free and get inspired without having to worry about the dreadful music licensing process that typically takes a ton of time and money.

369,YucNRt9eLBs,kold,KOLD - The War against Poaching.,"Back in February i was given the opportunity to see first hand how Vetpaw works day and night to protect not only Rhinos but all kinds of endangered animals. This trip was life changing to say the least, and i felt compelled to share with the world the story of Vetpaw and the incredible things they are doing to help these animals. 

During this trip my eyes had been opened to the reality of poaching and how animal populations are diminishing faster and faster each year because of this. With some species of Rhinos already gone extinct, the remaining Rhinos are in the danger zone. As the demand for Rhino horn goes up, so does the value, and poachers are risking it all to kill Rhinos in order to get their hands on a horn.

Organizations like Vetpaw exist to protect these animals from the harm of poachers and create a safe and comfortable environment for these animals to live in. Vetpaw has just opened up their second sanctuary and have plans to create the largest rhino sanctuary in the world. This is no easy task especially without the funds to make it happen. Thats where you can help! Vetpaw is a donation based organization and need donations to operate and expand. 

1.If this video has impacted you and you feel like helping, the first step would be to just share this video. :) raising awareness and spreading the message is the first step.

2.If you feel the need to help even more than you can go a step further and donate directly to Vetpaw here:

So when Huawei hit me up about their Huawei P20 Pro smartphone to take it on my travels I was really excited to try it out! Especially after seeing it ranked the #1 of smartphone camera in 2018 on DxOMark for a while. I had this phone for over 3 months and I gotta say that the camera is really good. For photo quality, this phone compares to a DSLR. I have a ton of flexibility when editing because of its RAW format and 40mp sensor.

It is located near Kamshet around 60 km from Pune. The village nearest to the fort is called Tikona-Peth. The 3500 foot high hill is pyramidal in shape and the name Tikona means ""triangular"". I explored this trek during monsoon trek. But if you visit in winters then you can do night camping and watch star trail here. For full experience, watch this video.

The weather was beautiful! we started early morning from pune and took the tamhini ghat route to reach devkund  and it took around 3 hours! But the evening the weather turned bad and it started raining heavily with thunderstorm! The waterfall became so dangerous that we barely made it back home! This was one of the crazy adventure! Hope you enjoy. If you are planning go in the end of September and Starting of October.

550,L0U8Lseq1qE,Ankit Bhatia,"How Trekking in korigad fort, Lonavala feels like","I have always explored Western ghats of Maharashtra in the monsoon season but this time round, I took to road on a day trip to Lonavala with my friends during winters. We started our day with the sunrise at Tiger point, explored Amby Valley and then went to the Korigad fort to experience something different. Our very long day journey was comfortable and stress free because of our comfy companion, Honda WR-V. The car is very spacious too to keep all the gears safely and without any hassles. For all the travel junkies, Honda WR-V ticks all the boxes. BreakTheRoutine @Hondacarindia

652,aSb_nBk2At4,Ankit Bhatia,BASICS OF PHOTOGRAPHY,"JOIN MY CONTEST WITH YOUR BEST PHOTO: https://shuttout.me/ankitbhatia 

Basics of Photography - If you want to be good at anything, you have to learn basics first. Like if you want to be pro in videos, you should be good at photos first. That's what we talked about, ""shutter"", ""aperture"", ""ISO"", ""camera lens"". If you know these things then you know how exactly your picture is going to look like even before clicking it.

Hope you participate in the contest I hosted for you guys. I will check all your photos. The best may win the prize :)

It’s like a DREAM COME TRUE which I will never forget in my life. I used to think of going to Himalayas once, you know when you climb up those beautiful mountains , you feel taller and stronger than anyone and you forget all the worries that you have, You just live in the moment. You actually don’t realize until you get there. Today I am living that dream and it feels amazing.

I spent 7 days in Himachal which comes under western Himalayas region in the north India. I visited Kullu, Manali, Rohtang, Spiti, Balu Ka Gera, Jawara, Shia Goru, Hampta Pass. 

Hope you liked these small glimpses of Himachal. I just can’t wait to share the experiences I had on this journey with you all in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.

This is so easy to create yet very effective to use in your travel video if you have some under water clip. In this tutorial, we basically muffle audio to create under water sound effect so that one could actually feel that the camera is under water.

701,Uyj-iJdtEdo,Ankit Bhatia,Let's Go GOA - Travel Diaries,"~~~~    Let's Go Goa    ~~~~

This video is dedicated to my best friends - Avinash & Anmol. 

Lately, I visited Goa for the first time in my life with my best friends. We know each other since childhood and never been out together for any trip and this was the first time we made it. We started planning for the trip 6 months before, could you actually believe that how much efforts would have taken to make this trip happen. Though nobody plans for GOA for so long but it was us and we are different :) but finally here is our story that I am sharing with you. Hope you like it.

I use this effect a lot in my videos so I thought to share it with you guys. Its really effective and gives a smooth transition from one frame to another. Hope this will help you in creating good content. You can also use time remapping but  I think this is easy and fast to do.

I went there in October end and it was so beautiful but there were very less flowers so the best time to visit this place would be September end when flowers are at maximum bloom. There are lot of resorts on that plateau, if you are visiting there make sure you stay there for one night, its beautiful in the morning.

Mostly these LUTs are for SLOG footage but you can also apply these in your normal Rec-709 footage and later change Basic correction (For Rec-709 type footage. Make Contrast +25, Highlights +70, Shadows -70, Whites -70, Blacks +70)

I hope it will help you and make your life easy while color grading. Please Like, comment and share the video. It will help all the Photographers/Videographers.

Shooting TimeLapse :
1. If you don't have inbuilt timelapse option then You Need timer remote control.
2. Always click in Aperture Priority Mode.
3. Patience ! :D

LYRICS
Im taking bangers with my bro bros and camera ra
You can catch us in Mykonos or Panama ma
Im pretty sho we looking like a million dollas 
My booty too big you need a panorama 
Im just taking bangers with my bros
Snap woah Im just taking bangers with my bros

Pose pose pose yeah I love taking photos 
Fire off a headshot 360 no scope
got my blue check for a price on the low low
Clients mad at me but I'm keeping my composure 
Yeah I caved now they’re paying with exposure
Im still making bread with this fire like a toaster
Im a lucky thang Im a 5 leaf clover
And when its time to bang tell boys to come over 

Im taking bangers with my bro bros and camera ra
You can catch us out in SoHo or Guatemala 
Im too fly probably hanging out a helicopter   
His booty too big you you need a panorama
Im just taking bangers with my bros
Snap woah im just taking bangers with my bros

When my bros wanna shoot I'm gone say yes
And you know I hit it raw no JPEGs 
Got my body got my lens 
Yeah Im looking like a 10 
Tell my client they can wait cause im banging with my friends

Im taking bangers with my bro bros and camera ra
You can catch us out in Tokyo or in Canada da
Im counting all this money like its algebra bra
His booty too big you need a panorama 
Im just taking bangers with my bros
Hold up woah pose im just taking bangers with my bros

If the client hits you up say no, no
Go outside instead and take some bangers with your bros
If the client hits you up say no, no
Go outside instead and take some bangers with your bros
If the client hits you up say no, no
Go outside instead and take some bangers with your bros
If the client hits you up say no, no
Go outside instead and take some bangers with your bros
Im just taking bangers with my bros

Lyrics:

Are you mad that this lil white boy in a turtle neck is rapping better than you ever will?
Are you mad that your girl just bought my turtle neck cause she loved how my sweaters feel
Trophies up on my pedestal, hard headed got a head of steal
5’9 with a big nose and but these girls loving my sex appeal 
I see it I want it I take it 
I want it now and Im feeling impatient
Your girl is down, and she thinks Im the greatest
When she came into town yeah we got a bit wasted
Then we slowed it down like we lived in the matrix
She wanted to pound, like a British payment
She needs her freedom, time to face it 
You in her DMs, Im in her playlist

obviously this just hobby to me
But when I hop on the beat, Im a body to beat
 Yeah Im gonna follow my dream 
Aint noone stopping the cream
Cause we stay creamy 
Uhuh okay
Like pillsbury - got the dough boy 
Yeah we stay creamy 
You good man? I gotta know boy

Are You Mad 
Sour Cream Sour Sour Cream
Are You Mad 
Sour Cream Sour Sour Cream

Are you mad? You look bitter,
You trash, you litter
Im a grown man you little boy 
Let me get you a babysitter
Cameraman, I know you heard of the kid 
Danmit man, I know its hurts a bit,
When you understand, that im the man, who made the brand, that made your girls turtleneck 
What brand is that?
What brand you ask?
Its called staycreamy.com and we have all of these turtlenecks for sale for only $69
Im a young euntraprenuer  if you want to support 
Grab one now cause they’re gonna go fast
yeah I put an in my song
You look mad is that wrong
Cause if so man then  I gotta ask 

Are you mad?
Sour Cream Sour Sour Cream
Are You Mad 
Sour Cream Sour Sour Cream

768,MNwS9RI0Bw8,Sam Newton,Just A Moment - Canon EOS R6 Mark II Cinematic Film,"I had the honor to take the brand new EOS R6 Mark II and create one of the first films ever shot on it as a part of the launch. 

Pretty surreal typing that out. This was an overwhelming opportunity and we only had 3 days heads up, 3 days to film, and a week to turn it around - so I grabbed some of my best friends and we went out and made it happen. I'm stoked on how it all came together.

Lyrics:

Naughty Little Film Boy 

Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off (Ima a naughty lil film boy)
I don’t organize my files you should see my desktop 
Teal and Orange color pallet never checkin white balance
And I don’t ever shoot In log (Im a naughty lil film boy)
Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off 
Cause im a naughty lil film boy

She like my Ass and she like Pecs call that Asspec Ratio
I asked your girl whats her favorite aspect ratio 
She said she likes 16:9 (69), 
Wait -  Im don’t think she talking bout aspect ratios

Bet it would be tasty though, she heard this DP Crazy yo
She knew I was naughty when she saw me shooting 1080 tho
12000 ISO when there’s no light in frame
Haters call it noise, man I just call it film grain

Cause Im another breed brand deal cost 100 Gs
always keep it 1000, just like I keep shutter speed
Im the camera man, aint another man in front of me
never slowing down,   im never im never buffering
I killed the game, took it right out of its suffering 
Go pull up a chair, baby we can share a cup of cream
Naughty film boy they can never get enough of me, the king like
       
Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off (Ima a naughty lil film boy)
I don’t organize my files you should see my desktop  (Ima a naughty lil film boy)
Teal and Orange color pallet never checkin white balance
And I don’t ever shoot In log (Im a naughty lil film boy)
Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off 
Cause im a naughty lil film boy

They call me funny boy, so I laugh it up
I asked your girl to shoot and you know she couldn’t pass it up oh oh oh oh 
she said she left her hard drive at hoooooome
You bet your ass she still backed it up 

You know Im fast as fuck, im fast just like my lens be yeah
But I forgot an ND, so Ima shoot F20 (bbbblrrrrr)
Haters I got plenty, but they have no friends
Probably cause they with that POTATO yeah

F anamorphic, Ill just add cinematic film bars
taking shots like Im at a cinematic film bar
Im the g best, I raise the cinematic film bar 
Run that shit back those were some cinematic film bars

She said be honest
Home many ochicks call you man at home
I said there probably R6 like my camera yo
She said thats  alright I only needs one night
So I hit her with the d-log and ghost like a phantom pro 

Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off (Ima a naughty lil film boy)
I don’t organize my files you should see my desktop  (Ima a naughty lil film boy)
Teal and Orange color pallet never checkin white balance
And I don’t ever shoot In log (Im a naughty lil film boy)
Im so naughty I leave my lens caps off 
Cause im a naughty lil film boy

Instagram Reels Song

People say art Is dead, but I would say thats a lie

Because creators these days are doing one thing to push the boundaries of originality 

The avant garde artists of our time have developed an Innovative form of thought provoking art that transcends what it means to Create 

We’re making instagram reels
Just copy someone else, you know the deal
We’re making instagram reels
do what copy someone else, no need for skill

DRONE SHOT ON A MOUNTAIN
It's honestly pretty straight forward

 This video was something I really enjoyed creating. It wasnt shot on Super 8mm film it was shot all digitally and edited to look this way (super original I know)

Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do, you seemed to love the New Zealand Super 8 video, If We All Die Tomorrow, so I thought I'd make something similar.

Ima take the shot like its the vaccination 
I don’t have the patients Im gone shoot right now
We undefeated you lose right now 


Click Click click click Swish
I could switch it up anytime like this 
Im a videographer and im on the verse
So when I shoot my shot I don’t miss


You know Im gone take the shot
You know Im gone take the shot
Pull up and take the shot
You know Im gone take the shot


Kid Newton, I been shooting, my shot  I
They into it, I been moving the rock 
My shits wet like I been   using a mop
You get that,  I been proving them wrong


Ive been taking shots, and now im starting to stutter
visions getting blurry, I should check my shutter
Im the camera man I need my camera madam
Shoot my shot like Im Ansels Adams 


I develop film not feelings 
I develop film not feelings 
I develop film not feelings 
I develop film not feelings 


You know Im gone take the shot
You know Im gone take the shot
Pull up and take the shot
You know Im gone take the shot

If you're this far in the description you must've liked the video a bit, help me out by taking 5 seconds to hit like before you leave, comment something funny, and make sure you are subscribed, little things like that help more than you think :) @samnewtonmedia

I’ve always been a fan of these home office tour videos where people break down their interior design. As a filmmaker and creative I needed a setup that was minimal, but clean and effective. I wanted to show the reality of my set up so I chose not to clean it all up too much and show you an inside look on my room. I spent around $2500 not including camera and laptop gear, I got a lot of it second hand from offer up and other stuff from amazon. I’ll link what I can below!

It's taken my 6 different tries to create a DIY desk setup and space I was stoked on and although I know its not perfect I thought I'd make a smaller BTS style video to run through my desk and office setup with you guys:)

Hopefully you guys enjoy this cinematic travel edit. We road tripped around the united states and filmed the entire thing. Shot on the canon 1dxiii and R5

807,07LMqqCDhpw,Sam Newton,things are changing,"The last month of 2020 was amazing for me. But it all got a bit overwhelming at times with a lot of things happening in my life, and too be quite honest I wasn't really feeling myself.  I just needed to make something. And this is what I came up with, since a lot of you seemed to enjoy the super 8 New Zealand video I thought I'd make something similar, enjoy the return of soppy sam.

This entire project was shot on the Panasonic LUMIX S5, big thanks to the team over at @LumixUSA 
This camera was a blast to shoot on, the 10 bit made color grading fun again. 

Check out the Lumix S5 for yourself here:

You know I be killing this beat I’ve been given, tell Peter McKinnon, get out of my way,

My Broll is lethal, I always deliver 
My whips automatic, im shooting manual 
My sh*ts so Kold itll make you shiver 
Your Brolls old you be looking like Daniel (Schiffer)

They compare me to Kolder
Man that shit is amusing,
I am the greatest alive
And he is like Peter, another canadian losing

Im heating up like the R5
Hole in one on a par 5
Yo sh*ts trash like Nikon 
Y’all should format hard drives

Imma end these channels when I take my crown
Matti, and Dietchy, and Make Art Now 
Mango, and Mathews, Christopher Hau
Your careers are undone when I take y’all down

Peter you soft like promist 
Im on top like I promised 
Imma end all my opponents
that’s what I’ve been about, y’all can forget about

Peter Mckinnon 
Peter Mckinnon
Its my time now, Im the new Peter Mckinnon (oof)

Peter Mckinnon attention 
Peter Mckinnon
I need my crown, Im the new Peter Mckinnon

Hope you enjoyed a diss track no one asked for

LYRICS:

If your girl wants to shoot,  I'm gonna say yes
and you know I hit it RAW, No JPEGs
While we’re strike a pose, for the image I compose
Fuck around, tag a brand, get a pay check 

Your in good hands baby I'm no amateur
Open up your heart, and I'll open up my aperture 
Drop it for me girl, yeah lower than my fstop
Lightroom presets, mobile and desktop

Your girl liked my photo? It would appear so
Cause she crashes at my house more than premier pro
Sam Newton, I'm a man of many talents
A white guy who raps you should check my white balance

Instagram feed yeah I gotta couple dimes in it 
How do you want it girl Analog or Digital
We can make a film, cause I know you like it physical

My shots are unforgettable, my feed is clean and minimal
My photos are original, my tones are irresistible
futures too bright, and I just raised the ISO
We can make a movie girl, Quinten Tarantino

817,kP7Dfj6UUfQ,Sam Newton,"Lightroom Presets, but for dope influencers only","Hey look, another creator selling their Lightroom presets. 
Teals? Oranges? Greens that look grey for some reason? I got you.

I noticed how many travel photographers and videographers have been dropping presets over the past few months, along with a ton of preset bundles, so naturally, being the asshole that I am, I wanted to make fun of it. Hope you enjoy.

All jokes aside I hope you are all doing well in these wild times. Please keep supporting creatives if you have the money, however the idea is that you should never feel pressured into buying a digital product because ""THERE'S ONLY 10 DAYS LEFT"". Only buy something that you truly see value in, and if you cant afford something, there are plenty of other ways to turn the saturation down on your greens.  Go hit up youtube and start learning yourself, its free and I promise will pay off in the long run.

Big thank you to Alex Romo for helping out with this!

Before you take off, please take a couple seconds to hit subscribe and turn on notifications, it helps more than you think :)

Shot on the Canon auto zoom 814 on Kodak 50 d film stock.

I've been stuck at home for the past 2 weeks and I started thinking about how much being trapped has made me appreciate the freedom of traveling that we used to have. Didn't know what to edit during these crazy times, so I thought I'd put together a video with some voice notes I had and Super 8 mm film footage from our road trip traveling New Zealand shot on Kodak 50D stock film.

LYRICS:

No Im not a filmmaker
Im a Content Creator 
Noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
and my life couldn’t be greater

No Im not a filmmaker 
Im a Content Creator
noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
Im traveling around the equator
cause Im a content creator

What do I do? Man I create content
I film dope shit, and use music without consent 
Working with brands, look at me in this poster
Did I make any money? Well I did it for exposure

Video color, teal and orange
travel so much that im feeling foreign
This is a palm tree,  that was an eagle soaring
My life is never boring, my shits original, 
hand placement is pivotal, always keep it subliminal 

My content is digital 
I make people feel miserable  
photoshop all my visuals
Im all about that money so sponsors stay visible 

No Im not a filmmaker
Im a Content Creator 
Noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
and my life couldn’t be greater
No Im not a filmmaker 
Im a Content Creator
Noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
Im traveling around the equator
cause Im a content creator

You heard that right Im content creator
Im living in a screen saver, Im standing on a sky scraper
Wanna be like me? Go grab some old denim, 
See those jeans? go and cut some holes in em
Go to Iceland, stand under a waterfall
Go to Bali,  stay under a waterfall
Go to dubai, grab some sand, let the breeze blow
You’ll look cool as hell, as long as them knees show
Im taking photos in mykonos, thats in greece babe
look at all this blue ass water, tiny meat gang
you wanna know how I live like this?
I make you feel like shit, and then I sell you some stuff

So I heard you wanna be the man,
Get out your camera boy and film yo hand
I heard you wanna kill it on the gram?
So get out  your camera and film yo hand

Should I learn about lighting?
f that just film your hand
Should I plan out my videos?
f that just film your hand
What about storylines?
f that just film your hand
Well I can backflip?
yeah that one is important

No Im not a filmmaker
Im a Content Creator 
noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
and my life couldn’t be greater
No Im not a filmmaker 
Im a Content Creator
noone knows what that means, but I got my ripped black jeans
Im traveling around the equator
cause Im a content creator

827,RHG5TEN-AB8,Sam Newton,How to Become a Travel Videographer (3 Tips),"My biggest piece of advice for people wanting to make travel videos full time:

Stop looking for the easy way out.

Everyone always wants a quick and easy way into an industry. People look for hacks to go viral, or quick steps to take to get paid to travel quickly, but what I've learned through years of doing this, is that the people that travel creating videos almost always have put in the time to make it happen, so be patient and don't try to cut corners.

If you truly want to learn to make travel videos, and get paid to make them: then be patient and stay consistent. Hopefully I will do a video soon breaking down how my company works and go into more detail on how I get paid making travel content.

Subscribe if you haven't and share with your friends! Little things like that go a long way for me.

I had this idea such a long time ago but was too nervous to do it because I thought no one would be a part of it, that couldn’t be further from the truth. We had over 80 submissions to this and it’s so incredible to see how many people went above and beyond to help me make something so dumb 😂 thank you to everyone who submitted, I honestly can’t wait to do this again.

Chemistry Love Affair by Khemistry Krew, Three High school rappers from Claremont High School wrote this song for their amazing Chemistry Teacher Randall Dingwall. 

Video Directed by Jose Jimenez and Jerry Quoe

Music By Sam Newton
LYRICS:

(Sam Blomberg)
R-A-N-D-Why is he so fresh like spearmint breathe
Every time he chuckled my tear ducts went
So crazy and maybe just lately
he always amaze me when he call me baby
D to the I N G to the Wall
His face is sacred like the Taj Majal
And underneath it all he's smiling back at me and greetings in the hallways always attract me.
Goofy never looked so good on a t-shirt
Ding weezy magic heals us when we hurt
I got to Rap it Rapture attack it
to let you know just how much you really matter
Chemistry lent me attempting memory
Never seemed endeavoring
until you came and bettered me haha
Yeah look at him balancing equations
talented Caucasian I just wanna praise him
Listen up you won't ever ignore us,
come on Sammy Take em back to the chorus

**CHORUS**
(Sam Newton)
Hey Hey How you doing Mr. D
And Hey Hey I just wanna learn some chemistry
and Hey Hey How you doing Mr. D
I wanna learn some chemistry
Just you and me
**CHORUS**

(Cooper Weissman)
There's this man named Randy have you met this guy
He's got a smile on his face and a sparkle in his eye
And I really don't know why I cry every night
Just want you in my life need you by my side
Your love burns like a cut and Peroxide
You choke me up just like carbon monoxide
I love you and not even in a wierd way
ok it's kinda wierd
But I really mean it when i say
I dream about you every night think about you everyday
My rabbi asked me if I believed in heaven
I said you know it dogg it's called room 407

(Sam Newton)
Yo dingwall how you doin bro
We go together just like h2 and 0
When i had to leave yourclass first semester
I survived off the memories of your amazing lectures
Mr. D its no mystery
That when im in chemistry everything is in harmony
And I wish we were born in the same decade,
We would be the sam age, maybe college roommates.
Then we'd be best friends, partying till the night ends, Talking about our feelings, our man friend feelings.
But dont be creeped out i love you like a dad
And your probably the coolest teacher that I have ever had
And When i switched out of your class you know it really shook me
But now everything is fine, because I know you can face book me
When you're mad you give me your angry stare
But I know on the inside youll always be my little teddy bear,
And i know you have a wife, but i dont really care,
You could just call it a one sided chemistry love affair

841,p3fm5ADktP4,JR Alli,a MOMENT in Dubai.,"One of the last trips I took this year was to the city of Dubai. During our short time there we captured the buzzing sci=fi looking city and travelled to the desert to understand the heritage/culture of the people. Unfortunately our trip was cut short as we just got back home before borders closed.. I still wanted to share some memories of our time there. I hope you enjoy a MOMENT in Dubai.

On the last night I sat down and recorded a Voice Memo, posing myself a simple question: What keeps drawing me back here? This became the voice-over to this short video. I hope I can visit this place again when I'm older, because I truly feel like the moments I had here have shaped my life forever. Thank you Iceland.

850,XzXWDfRowcA,JR Alli,Silence the Voices. // Out of Sight SUMMER,"https://outofsight.ca/

3 Designs to Encapsulate the Nostalgic Feelings of Summer.

3 Years Ago I started making videos behind my house. It was my excuse to get out of the house and make the most of my Summer. To be honest, I was so lost in life. I always had my camera with me and skateboard. The forest behind my house became my playground, my escape, it allowed me to dream. We all start somewhere, and so I wanted to take you back to where it all started for me.

851,v3z98nm_5yc,JR Alli,Out of Sight.,"https://outofsight.ca/

Ever since I started creating videos on YouTube and connected with people who had similar visions as me, I felt like I finally belonged somewhere. Out of Sight is a brand that represents the creatives who are carving their own path in this digital age and refuse to let go of their passions. The ones who put the work in behind the scenes when no one is watching, to hopefully one day share with the entire world. I always thought I'd never be able to create a clothing brand. I made this project in large part to show people that if a kid in the suburbs who started making videos behind his house with a camera and a dream could do it, you can to.

Only 150 Shirts will be available for this first drop. Once it's gone, it's gone forever.

Special Thanks to all the Creatives featured in this video:

THANK YOU to Visit Brussels for setting up this whole week. Plan a trip to Brussels NOW: https://visit.brussels/en

I quickly fell in love with New York City's hustle and bustle, bright lights and amazing characters. It feels like a minute goes by much faster here, you blink and you'll miss a moment. Here are a few of those moments that I was able to capture.

870,p_nRzDp38Nk,JR Alli,My Year 2017 - Frozen Memories | JR Alli,"Thank you for being apart of another incredible year. I'm just getting started. This is dedicated to everyone who believes in my vision. ❤

At the beginning of this year I was still in film school realizing very quickly that the path wasn't the right one for me. With support from my family, friends and of you amazing people, I dropped out and told myself I'm going to work as hard as I can to make creating videos a full time passion, even without a degree. Sitting here exactly one year later, I can say I never looked back and it's nuts to be able to say I'm so close to doing this full time. I was able to move out aswell which was a huge milestone for me. I want to continue to go on adventures, meet new people and tell stories for those whose stories are not always heard. I'm not taking my foot off the gas pedal. 2018, let's get it.

871,8aYOd1mAJXg,JR Alli,Lost in Translation (Shot on iPhone),"I've been feeling a little uninspired lately, especially as this year comes to an end. It's evident that we can't be happy all the time, and that's true for me as well. Maybe it's burn out or maybe it's the Ups and Downs of a creator. This is for those who feel uninspired or unmotivated. The feelings will pass, so just spend time with the ones you love and reflect on all the things you've accomplished thus far. Happy Holidays!

This was shot completely on the iPhone so excuse the quality and try and focus on the story and message. It was very scary to share something like this but I'm happy I did. Special thanks to my Mom for being the strongest person I know.

I had to re-upload this video because I was accused of stealing a clip (lasted only 1 second in the video). The owner did not want to talk about working it out and attacked me on all my social medias filing a complaint with YouTube giving me a copyright strike and taking the video down. It's an unfortunate situation, but if you've already watched it, please show it some love again and click the like button. I'm working on a vlog that should be rolling out in a few weeks and a video for Toronto. Thanks for all the love and support.

During my time in Vancouver past December, I had a few days off from working on some projects to head over to Sky Helicopters and take a flight through the Beautiful British Columbia Backcountry with VISUALCHOI. The moody clouds and amazing landscapes left me in awe. We were flying left and right through the clouds and without a doubt this was one of the coolest things I have ever done. Hope you enjoy this much more laid back, calm and moody Vibin' episode!

885,m81vSrc6b0A,JR Alli,Into the Wild - Short Film (Explore Ontario),"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods
There is a rapture on the lonely shore
There is society, where none intrudes 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar
I love not man the less, but Nature more
I now walk.. Into the Wild.
Short Film by: JR Alli

A few months back, I needed a break from life and technology. My friend Kenny and I decided to venture Into the Wild for a few days away from distractions with nothing but good conversations and room for the mind to wander. Although it was cold and we lived off Ramen by the campfire, it was a much needed time away from life. A huge inspiration of mine for seeking adventure and real experiences in life started with reading the book ""Into the Wild"" and for these few days Chris McCandless words resonated with me deeply: “I don’t want to know what time it is. I don’t want to know what day it is or where I am. None of that matters.”

898,s2-bhHSQIaU,JR Alli,Nature Sparks Creativity,"I've come to realize something important that all of us as humans neglect. We all have been, since the dawn of time, connected to nature in a way that is unspeakable. It is Human Nature to be connected to Nature. We all have the capabilities to create and be creative too. So to those who need to find some creativity, go out in Nature, your ideas will fly and soon you will realize that Nature is what Sparks Creativity in all of us.

The triple-camera system changes the game completely, housing three sensors and lenses with different focal lengths. It gave me a new love and appreciation for flying drones. From the durability, to the sleek design and ergonomic controller, this drone exceeded my expectations. The insanely long battery life allowed me to fly much further and not stress about flying back so soon. DJI really went above and beyond and made sure the attention to detail was there for this setup. Also, the software runs so smoothly which is a big win for me. It will be with me in all my travels and I can confidently say it’s the best drone I’ve ever flown.

Get involved with the next charity project: https://www.instagram.com/amirzakeri/

The past 5 months have consisted of traveling with the http://karmagawa.com team to 7 countries around the world, documenting the degradation of locals reefs and the critical state of the oceans. We interviewed many marine biologists, locals, and did a lot of diving. There’s one thing when you see things on a screen.. then it’s another when you see it for your own eyes. For this Kansas boy, its been an eye opening experience. It’s so scary what’s happening to our oceans and how fast we’ve ruined it. Out of sight out of mind? Ignorance is bliss? Welp... that lead us here, and it's up to you and me to change this!

Raising awareness and spreading the message is the first step in saving the reefs and our oceans! Share this video will all of your friends, family and followers on social media to help get the word out about this urgent crisis. 

Learn more about the charities that dedicate their lives to saving coral reefs all over the world at
https://savethereef.org

Lastly, it's my birthday wish that you not only share this video, but also take action. Stop supporting the companies who make these products that are poisoning our oceans and environment. They only produce if there is demand, so if we don't give them our dollar... they will be forced to change for the better. Let’s make them change!

Creation is a better means of self expression than possession. It is through the process of creating that life feels revealed. Do what you love with meaning and purpose and they will love what you do. Do what you want and say what you feel… because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind! Just BE YOU

I went to Oahu for 5 days to capture the exotic scenery of Kualoa Ranch and really see what 4,000 acres of true Hawaii looks like. My friends at Kualoa made this happen, and if it wasn’t for them none of this would have happened. This video involved no money, only collaboration.  Films such as Jurassic World, 50 First Dates, You Me & Dupree, Godzilla, Hawaii Five-0, Lost, and many more were all filmed here!

Kualoa Ranch is like the Disney Land version of Hawaii. They have amazing sight tours and activities that all people can enjoy. Horseback rides, ocean voyage tours, beach activities, ATV's, movie bus tours, jungle expeditions, and more! Make sure to check them out in the link here!  http://www.kualoa.com

Technical stuff: The Glidecam footage was all shot on my Canon 6D. Most of the shots were done with the Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam. A couple tripod stills were shot with a 70-200mm 4.0 L Series lens. I tried to always keep a low aperture to keep everything in focus and kept a constant ISO of 100 for almost all the shots. This was shot at 1080p @ 24fps. The drone used was the DJI Phantom 2 with a GoPro Hero 4 shot in 4k @ 24fps. I edited with Adobe Premiere Pro CC and color graded with Lumetri.

The smooth, floating-like shots were done with a Glidecam HD 2000.

This video features Maui and California skimmers and the world champion Austin Keen. Skimboarding is shorebreak surfing on a finless board. It's much harder than it looks, trust me haha. I shot this over 4 days, 1 day being all golden hour and sunset video. These guys are very talented and I now consider them all friends. This was all shot at Makena (Big Beach) on Maui.

This was shot on my Canon 6D, Ian's 7D, and a GoPro Hero 3+. I used my Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam and 70-200mm 4.0 L on a tripod. This was shot at 1080p @ 30fps and 720p @ 60fps. I edited in Premiere Pro CC. I color graded within Adobe.

The running shots on the sand were done with a Glidecam HD 2000. You can learn more about Glidecam's in the link below. They take a learning curve, but are amazing once you get the hang of em!

This video is inspired by Devin Graham's version of The Fire Knife Dance, if you haven't seen that yet, check it out here! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uxUNyQ_c1E

The Fire Knife Dancers I got to film are some of the best in the world and are all based out of Hawaii. My friend Chado helped produce the video and gather all of the dancers and plan out locations and times. He also supplied the guys with the fire knifes. It was a true honor to work with these guys and I now consider them all great friends. This video was all shot on Maui. Here are the names of all of the dancers I worked with, in the order they appear.

This was all all shot on my Canon 6D. All of the shots were done with my Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam. This was shot at 1080p @ 30fps. I edited in Premiere Pro CC. I didn't color grade at all or speed up any footage, all the footage you see is RAW, right from the camera (excluding the slo-motion of course). I used frame blending for the slo-motion to create the smooth blur effect.

The smooth, floating-like shots were done with a Glidecam HD 2000. You can learn more about Glidecam's in the link below. They take a learning curve, but are amazing once you get the hang of em!

I had the awesome opportunity to fly over to Kauai from Maui and create a video showing off the island. I was there for 8 days, and was able to capture almost all that the island has to offer. I spent 2 days hiking the Napali Coast alone, one of the most breathtaking things I have done. This island is beyond beautiful, and I definitely will be back :)

Technical stuff: This was all all shot on my Canon 6D. Most of the shots were done with the Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam. Some tripod stills were shot with a 70-200mm 4.0 L Series lens. I tried to always keep a low aperture to keep everything in focus and kept a constant ISO of 100 for almost all the shots. This was shot at 1080p @ 24fps. I used Compressor 4 before exporting out to YouTube.

This video was in collaboration with Tranquil Mvmt, and features Justin Sheaffer and Joe Lobeck. Tranquil is a parkour team that teaches the fundamentals and foundation of parkour and they have tutorials where they teach you how to start! These guys are very talented and are now good friends. http://www.tranquilmvmt.com/

This video is inspired by Devin Graham's famous Assassin's Creed Meets Parkour in Real Life. If you haven't seen that yet, check it out here!

As far as deciding how to plan this video, we wanted to incorporated both the nature aspect and the city. Assassins Creed, Ninja Turtles, and Ninja Gaiden were the inspirations for this. Who doesn't like ninja's? :)

Technical stuff: This was all all shot on my Canon 6D. All of the shots were done with my Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens. I use a B+W Polarizer for all my outdoor shots which brings out the colors greatly. This was shot at 1080p @30fps. Edited in Adobe Premiere Pro CC. 

As far as the smooth camera motion, I use a Glidecam HD 2000. You can check out more of Glidecam here!

This video could not have happened if it weren't for the amazing opportunity given to me by DoDat Vu. He is a breakdancer and an amazing tricker and is part of the team Boogie Munstars. I had the opportunity to film three of their talented breakers, DoDat Vu, Rayu Brown, and Joshie Sirivongxay. You can contact/follow the team here!

FaceBook: DoDatVu

Email: Datvu22@gmail.com

As far as the setting of this video and why I chose violin music, here's why. I want to make videos that people haven't seen before, and with all the breakdancing videos out there, most of them are to hip-hop music (I love hip-hop don't get me wrong), but I wanted to make something unique. That's why I chose Lindsey Stirling, she is a figure that inspires me and makes very abstract violin music. The setting was shot in 3 locations all in Kansas City. Kauffman Performing Arts Center, Nelson Atkins Museum, and Union Station in a random corner with a good spotlight:)

Technical stuff: This was all all shot on my Canon 6D. All of the shots were done with my Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam. I use a B+W Polarizer for all my outdoor shots which brings out the colors greatly. This was shot at 720p @ 60fps. I used Compressor 4 with my secret settings to top that off!  

The smooth, floating-like shots were done with a Glidecam HD 2000. You can learn more about Glidecam's in the link below. They take time to learn, but with practice comes smooth footage!

I flew down to Maui right after graduation to make a nature video for this amazing island. I had never been to Maui, only Oahu, so the entire island was a mystery. I spent the nights preparing for the next day of where to be at what time, to get the best shot with the best lighting. I was alone most of the time, adventuring by myself. I spent the nights editing my footage just to keep up with the new footage I would get from the next day of filming. If your visiting Maui for the first time hopefully this illustrates the amazing attractions! This is my first YouTube video and I'm very proud of my work. Subscribe to my channel for more Hawaii videos!

Technical stuff: This was all all shot on my Canon 6D. Most of the shots were done with the Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L Series lens on the Glidecam.

1042,DNY04pkZwPM,Aidin Robbins,Spring Showers - North Carolina on Super 8mm Film,"Scenes that have caught my eye over the last few months. This Spring has been a reminder to take notice of details I'd previously disregarded- green in the trees, ferns by the trail, the sound of rain on the leaves. Much like 8mm film, it's provided an opportunity to slow down and create casually- so I brought the Super 8 back out to capture some moments from the road and the trail. I hope this roll of film reminds you to slow down and look around :)

1056,zcHfETd4UoM,Aidin Robbins,Nature at its Most Unnatural - Cinematic Travel Film (BMPCC4K),"At times, our world can feel quite otherworldly- and nature can appear quite unnatural. This is a concept I’ve wanted to tackle for a while- combining dramatic weather with experimental effects to create a surreal portrait of the outdoors. At the start of the year, myself and the homie Andrew James took a spontaneous road trip to the Smoky Mountains to chase a winter storm. When we were met with 3 days of fog, cloud inversions, and an overall winter wonderland, I knew it was time to bring this surreal cinematic travel film concept to life.

This film began as a seemingly simple idea- to create a travel film driven by sound. In film, creative decisions are almost always made based on visuals, with sound being added in accordance to what is seen on screen. So, what if we flipped it? Choosing the PNW for its auditory density and character, I set off to create a travel film driven by audio.

Through planning, shooting, and editing, creative decisions were made based on sound- what do you need to hear to understand the story? Which sounds characterize the Pacific Northwest? This approach to filmmaking was unique from any other I’ve experienced, and after 9 months I couldn’t be more proud of the result. I hope this film inspires you to consider sound design with intention and listen closely the next time you travel.","['aidin robbins', 'aiden robbins', 'aidan robbins', 'pnw', 'pacific northwest', 'sounds of the pnw', 'sounds of the pacific northwest', 'washington', 'oregon', 'travel film', 'travel video', 'travel', 'cinematic', 'cinematic travel', 'cinematic travel video', 'cinematic travel film']",2020-05-16T15:00:09Z,708943,35711,1979,PT5M14S,hd,true

My last video about sound design was all about foley, so in this video I'm talking about atmospheric sound- sounds that aren't on screen but change how the shot/viewer feels. Astmospheric sound could be anything from the creepy ambience in horror movies to the infamous trailer boom sound, so here are the reasons to use it and how to find/make these sounds for yourself.

This video was not posted to my second ""vlog"" channel for several reasons.
